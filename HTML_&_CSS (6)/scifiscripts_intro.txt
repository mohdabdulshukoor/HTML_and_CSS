Note from poster to Kubrick newsgroup:

I found this on a bbs a while ago and I thought I'd pass it along to all 
of you Kubrick freaks out there.

Transcriber's note:

For all you Clarke/Kubrick/2001 fans,

I found the original paper copy of this screenplay a while back and felt 
compelled to transcribe it to disk and upload it to various bulletin 
boards for the enjoyment of all.

The final movie deviates from this screenplay in a number of interesting 
ways. I've tried to maintain the format of the original document except 
the number of lines per page of the original. In order to reduce the 
length of this file I've used a bar of "------" to delimit the pages as 
there was a lot of whitespace per original screenplay page.
