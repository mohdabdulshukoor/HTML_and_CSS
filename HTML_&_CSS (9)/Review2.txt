__label__1 Goes "Haywire" Regularly: Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print. I have tried it with several different PCs, with this same intermittent weird behavior. Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I'm off to buy an Epson!
__label__2 Old fashioned, sweet story.: Not much of a challenge to read. Enjoyed it just the same. It was a change from the modern world and therefore, I recommend it.
__label__1 Stay Away: This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.
__label__1 worst.........movie............ever: Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10,000 times better acting and a much more coherent plot too!
__label__1 Blu-Ray Review: What a terrible movie, garbage. It totally sucks. What is Hollywood coming to. It seems they are running out of stories to make movies about. What garbage. Good Lord. Right up there with Boondock Saints 2 and Smokin Aces 2.
__label__1 LAST Nicolas Cage film for me!: There is not ONE redeemable quality about this film. Period. Nicolas Cage is at the bottom of the barrel. He now has absolutely NO range. The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie. I think he seriously was on something! So here we are New Orleans Post Katrina. Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn't figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!
__label__1 What did I watch?: So he's a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don't know why I continued to watch.
__label__2 Great Writing: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?
__label__2 If you can't make it to Mongolia this season....: Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I'm so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land ("Welcome to Mongolia!" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book.
__label__1 Banal and Boring: No, I'm not making this up. Somebody actually produced this recording. Actually, two people produced it. Nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it. (I say "nearly," because most of the tracks were played by a trio, who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet.) I'm not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining: these folks certainly were not up to the task. The end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties. Unbelievable...
__label__2 GREAT ITEM: I find this item to be more than expectedand I think everyone should consider buying oneI will tell everyone about it
__label__2 Amazing Score.: Wow, words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece. First I will start with the movie, brilliant! That is all there is to be said about the film. Now the OST, beautiful work. A very dark and somber piece, very moody and atmospheric. Its not something you just listen to for fun, at least for me. Its more of a background music, while doing your business. Its just brilliant. Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild's work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film. Some tracks are very tranquil and moody, while others pound out beats and are very fast paced. All in all a 5/5 for the cd, a definate must have for any collection! Highly recommneded!
__label__1 Do not buy this camera: Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I returned mine.. I wish there was a way to fix it.
__label__2 Brio Medium straight track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. These pieces are a must for extending your existing train set. My 5 year old loves having these extra pieces to create with.
__label__1 It's too simple even for a KISS book: I know the whole point of "dummie" and "KISS" books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn't gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste.
__label__2 Quality from Tripp Lite as always: I always goes with the Trip Lite fiber patch cables, due to their quality, and not being so proud of their name they triple the price.
__label__1 awful: Big waste of money! After washing noticed 1 pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what I've tried. Stuck with it since I washed and can't find packaging.
__label__2 Good grill for the money.: I've been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill. I've used it to grill steaks, duck breasts, veggies, and chicken. Takes longer than a gas grill, but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen.
__label__1 Excessive Typos Ruined it for Me: Couldn't agree more w/ Prendergast's review concerning the laughable typos. I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves! How distracting to read a so called "classic" and find it reading like a HS sophomore paper - and a drunk sophomore at that! I somehow managed to finish the book, but came on Amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version. Weird. Typos, poor punctuation, etc. ruined it for me.
__label__2 entertaining action movie SPOILERS: the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.
__label__2 one more positive note: Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well.
__label__1 Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound: Don't buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks, the original Aussie version and the rotten American dubbed version. These dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants. Perhaps if nobody buys it they'll get a clue.
__label__2 This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980's: This is probably Mel Gibson's first film. A film he's done while he was in his 20's. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as "The Road Warrior." And "The Road Warrior" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today."Mad Max" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the "action hero" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.
__label__2 Great DVD packed with a ton of features!: I've seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you've seen this movie in the past and thought, 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying, 'It was great!'
__label__1 AWFUL: This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK!
__label__2 Oh, my God! It's Stereolab!!!: Ever since I got this album since last summer, I kept on thinking what this album will sound like. I never wanted to stop listening to this album, because their music is so spectacular. If you heard the first track, Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles' eerie song "Revolution 9" from the "White Album." I could've just imagined while listening to "Baby Lulu" and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I've ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you're at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)
__label__2 Perfect Family Fun!!!: This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray, a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right. His first job is helping Anabel Greening, played by Mara Wilson. Anabel's wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical, and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!
__label__2 Great kids movie: The Kids loved this movie Martin Short is hillarious. The fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for.
__label__2 Funny: This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture , we loved it. Came in excellent condition!
__label__2 Excellent Album: I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording & prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.
__label__2 Well Played Kid's Music: Trout Fishing In America make kids music, they do it well, and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it, even with adults, although I highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it's own merits. If you need a CD for your kids to listen to that won't drive you crazy, you have found it, but otherwise this is probably not a CD you want to own.
__label__1 Highway Robbery: It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!
__label__2 well....: i also really loved the book. it showed two strong willed people who are, at first glance, totally wrong for each other! i mean, a centuries old vampire, and a vampire slayer? it was ironic! i also liked that even though Quin was a cold fish on the outside, inside he was just as lonely as Rashel, even if he rarely admitted it. i loved the book and couldn't put it down! if u haven't read it yet, do so!
__label__1 Where are the woodwinds?: The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.
__label__2 Vivid colors; tight fit only lasts a few times: This puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction. As others have mentioned, the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box, because they are all wood and cut from one piece. After about three uses, however, they are now smooth and fit together well. I have not had a problem with splinters, but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces, I could see how splinters might develop.My 21-month old daughter loves this puzzle, and had no trouble putting it together without a visual "guide." The colors of each area are very distinguishable, so it's pretty easy to determine where each piece connects. We are happy customers!
__label__2 These Shoes are made for walking.: In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says, "Merrills are a hug for the feet." Even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable. These go everywhere! I love them.
__label__2 Persuasive book with an unusual approach: The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it.
__label__2 Another Sensual Gem from this Composer: This is yet another lush, shimmering pscyo-erotic opera by Franz Schreker, wonderfully performed by the forces involved -- I suggest you just read the review of 02/12/04 to get a good summary of the surreal plot. At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer's masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn't disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet's Carmen and a small handful of others, I'm not a great opera fan but Schreker's output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Kingston Technology KVR133X64C3/ 256 PC133 256MB 32MX64: Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before
__label__2 You'll enjoy this CD: I got a huge kick out of Vinny's interpretations of the Beatles' songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped, as has been written here. But the don't mimic previous covers, but try to recreate the early Beatle sound. It's light and it's fun. It's is not a must have as a Beatles fan, but I think you'll get a big kick out of this disc.
__label__2 Madonna is a great singer: Madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical. She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of "Lament" it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality. While in the song "Beuonos Aires" she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention. She is a great actor. If I could change one thing it would be to switch Jimmy Nail and Jonathin Pryce because Nail should sing more songs and Price should sing less.
__label__2 EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA!: All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas's accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.
__label__1 Disappointed in product quality and support: After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP's support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also.
__label__2 A text book worth keeping for reference: This is a text book that I will not be selling back! I like the reference style set-up, with tabbed pages. I am sure I will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses.
__label__1 A small leak, right out of the box: I had to try sleeping on it the first night - in a couple of hours it was less firm, which made it difficult to roll around on. It didn't take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton (because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough). Prospective buyers should be mindful of this.
__label__1 Did not last long: We used this for less than 21 days for a guest. It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning, it has shrunk to less than half it's inflated height. There is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out. We had to return it to Amazon. We bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress, not compact but less risky than an airbed.
__label__2 It's a great value!: I purchased a twin size Intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that I ordered a second. It was easy to inflate, held it's firmness, was VERY easy to take down and easily stored. Now when my granddaughters come to visit, they have their own bed and great pajama parties.
__label__2 Great bed for guests: I highly recommend this item, and it's a great price with Amazon Prime.My son uses this whenever he sleeps over. He loves it, says that it's like sleeping on a cloud. With the electric pump, which is attached, it inflates and deflates super fast. It also folds up into a rather small rectangle, and it comes with a canvas bag for store.
__label__2 comfortable sleep: I found this air bed to be perfect for 1 person. The ease in filling, the height, all exceptional!I would reccomend this bed to anyone.
__label__1 Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.
__label__2 Great Bed for Guests: Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!
__label__2 Intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump: Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable, I just wish it was a little higher. I would recommend this product.
__label__1 Do Not Buy: Inflates like a charm, then deflates under the weight of a child within 3-6 hours, I should have gone with my gut and purchased another Aerobed because the one I already have (queen) has worked for > 7 years.
__label__1 It would be great if it stayed inflated!: I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated, they are great. But, during the night, they slowing deflate. I have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours. I wish I would have bought a different air mattress.
__label__1 Valve broke after a couple of uses: My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won't close. It spins, but does not seal shut so you can't inflate the mattress. Very poor quality.
__label__2 Ecelente producto: Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento, no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo.
__label__1 WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN: THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS. THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON'S GREAT RETURN POLICY. IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM.
__label__1 Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop: We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is "save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on", that's what we're doing now.
__label__2 Comfortable: I bought this air mattress after researching the site. It is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all, NO LEAKING!!!
__label__1 Disappointed but shouldn't be surprised: I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope.
__label__2 Works well: The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.
__label__2 Great for the summer: My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student, I'm sure it will be used again.
__label__2 Quick and Easy: This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump.
__label__2 Love it: We recently moved into a smaller place. When my parents came into town, they took my oldest sons room. We needed something for him to sleep on but didn't have much room. This twin airbed by Intex is great! I love the fact that the pump is built in. It doesn't get in the way like I thought it might. My son says it's very comfortable. It's easy to inflate and deflate.
__label__2 Great Find at a Great Price: I needed to replace my airbed but didn't want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.
__label__2 Its better then a "normal" bed: I just moved out of my moms house and I did'nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I'm still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated, its like sleeping on a cloud.
__label__1 Electric pump failed: Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.
__label__2 Excellent product for the price: Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use, but adding air very easy.
__label__2 great mattress: I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.
__label__1 Would not recommend: I bought this for my off campus residence, and the two months it worked fine...and then the problems began. First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn't think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela's.
__label__1 Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!: I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can't use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night.
__label__2 The Best Air Mattress EVER!!!: I love this air mattress so much. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too. It is very sturdy and durable as well. Over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone's place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself
__label__2 Fantastic: Bought the Intex pillow rest for visits/visitors. Inflation is quick, quiet and easy. Deflation works the same. Slight loss of air by early morning. Fits back into tote nicely, take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric, fold in thirds length wise, then role from bottom toward pump/pillow end. Easy to tote and store.
__label__2 Better than the Queen size bed: I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you're looking for a bed for just yourself, this should be perfect!
__label__2 Step's Best Work So Far!: I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD "Standing Room Only." "I'm So Glad" has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a "must buy" for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco, Step would win for performer of the year.
__label__2 200 bucks?: I paid 95 at comp usa (known for being overpriced) over a year ago.anyways, The case doesn't get the best air so I'd recommend getting more fans.If you have problems with the front USB hubs (pc freezes when you plug something in them), unplug the very BOTTOM black wire.[r|r][w|w][g|g][b|b][b|[]
__label__2 DVD review: Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.
__label__1 Not worth the money: Not what I thought I was getting. I don't think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out.
__label__2 good: It was good, is not like out of this world and really amazing, but it works soooooo good! If you put a lot of pressure when your using it, it turns off automatically, that sucks!
__label__1 Too Expensive: I used it once and have not touched it since, the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft, Waste of MONEY
__label__1 No way!: This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.
__label__1 Not worth the money: What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money.
__label__2 GREAT prodct: For those wondering, like myself, this DOES come in a discrete package. Now, as for the actual product? OMG I've never felt something like this before. This is my first official toy, and I am sooooo pleased! It's a little large, and kinda hard but that's okay. Works wonderfully. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price.
__label__1 Awful: This was much bigger then I had anticipated, that being my own fault. But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt! The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable. So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated! Not one bit pleased with this product.
__label__1 Too big!: While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don't think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product.
__label__1 Awful!: I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the "bunny ears" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product.
__label__1 HATE IT!: I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!
__label__2 Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn't jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum "my first vibrator" hahaha!It's really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more "lifted" off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!
__label__2 After 6 years, this album is still awesome.: This album contains danceable techno and mellow techno (trancey/ambient). Unlike most albums, ALL of the songs on this album are great. You'll definitely get your money's worth from this album. And even though it's over 6 years old, the music still sounds brilliant. Like Michael Stipe of R.E.M. said, this album was several years ahead of its time.
__label__1 I'm glad I didn't pay for it.: I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up.
__label__2 Great book!: This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.
__label__2 Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD's) - Good: This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her "dialouges" between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs, like "Evergreen" (I would have preferred her to sing that one alone), "The Music of the Night" , & "Somewhere" (not favorable with Il Divo)
__label__1 Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!: Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter...
__label__1 misleading photo: There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the "too good to be true" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier.
__label__1 Waste of money: If you get to this review, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I'm forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box. A watse of money! Nuff Said!
__label__1 What a waste!: After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.
__label__1 Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!: Picked one of these up the other day, mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that's all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 "generations" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS.
__label__1 Confused: I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I've tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first.
__label__2 Great deliver of all products: Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don't know how they were liked.
__label__2 Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story: Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies. Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn't have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them.
__label__1 Oh Romeo: Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
__label__2 A good introduction to the tragedies.: Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.
__label__1 RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!: We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!
__label__1 Good book -- but not this edition: This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version.
__label__1 How do films like this get made?: If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That's it!
__label__1 What the Heck ???: The uniforms were ridiculous, mixing ribbons and stripes on officer's uniforms..the technical advisor should be fired....I had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep...Kevin Sorbo...puleeze don't get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again...a real stinker !!!!!
__label__1 Cute, But a Little Cheap...: This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don't really like it, myself. I think it could be better.
__label__1 Disappointed: I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn't lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!
__label__1 no color, no buy: I wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter, but was afraid I'd end up with black. So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!
__label__2 Not classic Yello - but very very good!: Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello's other albums and, in my opinion, doesn't hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey's style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!
__label__1 Disappointed!: Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? "Mom - it's really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!"I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library's collection! (I won't....I'll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg's out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won't give it 5 stars any more!
__label__1 A double edged sword: This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson "in his own words" but were nothing more than fabrication.
__label__1 MANSON HATES EMMONS.: Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,"Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he's milked you for two books.. he's a good crook."The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than 1 percent is factual.
__label__1 Lies, Lies, Lies: For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it.
__label__1 REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!: DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said "man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system" even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 I couldn't put it down: Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable.
__label__1 sadly predictable: If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don't mind the writer's technique or don't see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.
__label__1 Struggled Through!: I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!
__label__1 Klaatu Hopeless: I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However "Hope" is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would.
__label__2 A Must read: This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.
__label__2 A unique take on a classic theme: I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating.
__label__2 One Brave Act changes a civilization: this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing "object" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read
__label__2 GREAT Dali book .... Great Amazon price: Love the book, love dealing with Amazon.com I've been dealing with Amazon for years now, and have never had a problem with them. THANKS ONCE AGAIN AMAZON.
__label__2 Great space heater!: It swivels, has a remote and a tipover safety feature, and you can mount it on the wall if you desire. It works wonderfully, providing plenty of heat when you need it.
__label__2 Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.: After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of "Portrait of a Marriage" years ago, I went on a search for more information about the life of Vita Sackville-West. This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA's library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call "The Three V's." The three V's are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge.
__label__1 Buyer Beware!!: If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!
__label__1 This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale: Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration.
__label__1 Worst scanner I've owned.: I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The "auto" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do.
__label__2 a childhood favorite: In "The Greengage Summer" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended.
__label__2 Forget Belkin, look no further than the GUF320: This thing was easy to intall. I have a Dual 1.25 G4 Mac. No driver installations under Panther 10.3.3. If you're pre 10.2.X on a Mac you'll have to visit Iogear's website for USB 2.0 drivers. You shouldn't have any problems using this card with a G5 given the bus supports PCI cards either. Apple should just sell this card in their stores. This is my first Iogear product, and this is the best combo firewire/usb PCI card currently on the market.
__label__2 Great Book: For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you, this book is great, and the shortest of the six books in the Asian Saga. Plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you. Emotionally, and as a result of reading a good book
__label__2 Most Interesting Ending: This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the "natural disaster" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too
__label__2 Afghan lovers unite: This is a great new book from our friends at Liesure Arts, I had so much fun looking at all the new patterns and color combos. I recomment this book take it to the yarn store with you and pick a design and then your favorite colors and enjoy.
__label__1 complete nuisance: I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box.
__label__1 bad company: The scanner looks nice but very deceiving, I bought this scanner because of the name Xerox.I had it for about 2 months and scanned maybe 100 sheets, now it died!Xerox after 3weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say I will get a refurbished unit. (Bad company)
__label__1 does not work: You get two sets of dice: one that always comes up 7 or11 and another set. Planned to have some family fun with it. Only fun we had was how it did not work at all. The 7-11 set comes up all kinds of numbers. What were they thinking with this item?
__label__1 Decent player... while it lasts: After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.
__label__1 Poor substitute for an iPod: Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap.
__label__1 Yet another broken headphone jack.: After roughly a year of fairly reliable use, I've also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack. Now i'm wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago ("limited" being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider "fixing", and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would've given this item four stars. After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect, I'm outright angry that I'm not alone.
__label__2 Discontinued 70PD05500032?: Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as "Discontinued". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.
__label__2 Works Great So Far: Very simple and good looking coffee bean grinder.Pros:1. Compact size2. Looks good3. Easy to UseCons:1. I wish the cable was a bit longer2. The measurement for 4 people coffee bean level is a bit hard to read. I like to grind as few beans as possible, since I am the only one drinking coffee at home, and I have some trouble estimating how much to grind.
__label__2 Great product: The hands free is wonderful and it is much quieter than the push down button one we had before. Much easier to clean.
__label__1 Design is flawed.: If you grind a lot of coffee, over time you will realize that the rotation of the grinders is in the same direction as you slide the cover to remove it. The result is, that you will have to physically hold the top to the base when you grind beans.After a little over four years, the motor of the older model of this unit burned out.I should have never gotten rid of my Krups grinder.
__label__1 Unevenly grinds beans: This grinder does not work well if you use a French press to make coffee. It grinds the beans very unevenly - some large pieces and some very fine dust, even on the "Percolator" (coarsest) setting. When you brew the coffee the fine dust goes right through the metal filter and ends up in your cup.On the plus side, it is easy to clean and maintain. It may work fine if you use paper filters.
__label__1 Unreliable: First thing in the morning, while I'm still waking up and maybe a tad groggy, the last thing I want is a finicky coffee grinder. I bought this coffee grinder and used it daily for a few months, when it started working only some of the time. Some days it would work righty off the bat, and other days it had to be disassembled and cleaned and reassembled, usually 2 or 3 times... unplugging it every time for safety. This added annoying minutes to the process of getting the first cup of coffee in the morning. It got to be so annoying that I put the grinder away in the cabinet and bought a bag of pre-ground coffee. When that ran out, the coffee grinder came out of the cabinet again, and this time it didn't work regardless of how many times it was cleaned and disassembled. Now I'm in the market for a new coffee grinder.
__label__1 Bought this grinder with great expectations.: It was supposed to do all the things my old grinder did and more. I took it out of the box and ........... nothing. It didn't ever work, period. Very disappointing. Is there a rating lower than one star. If there was, I would use it.
__label__2 Not for arachnophobes!: The Hobbit is no Spiderman or Battlefront (the attacks are two buttons) and the graphics are only ok. But its just fun for the ride. The hardest things in the game are not the villains but the adventure challenges. You play as Bilbo Baggins through Hobbiton, through the dark goblin caves and troll caverns, all the way to the Dragon Smaug. The graphics are very in-your-face, however (Being an arachnophobe, I nearly fell off my chair when a spider jumped out at me!). I admit, if you are into adventure games with a little more action, I reccomend the Lord Of The Rings games or The Chronicles Of Narnia: Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe. It doesn't have too much action, especially at the beginning. This is the perfect game to get into gaming with, it's short and sweet.And if you are a serious gamer, get this for your PC as well.
__label__2 Awesome: I got this CD off Amazon last Christmas and it's something I've listened to throughout the year. I would highly recommend any music on the Glass Armonica, and Dean Shostak certainly makes a go of it.
__label__2 Tells the Truth About the Ukrainian Genocide of the Poles: During World War 2, Ukrainian-fascist-nationalists (the UPA, the so-called Ukrainian Insurgent Army), imitating the German Nazis, murdered over 100,000 Polish civilians in the most brutal manner imaginable. After collaborating with the Germans in the genocide against the Jews in 1942, the Ukrainian nationalists abandoned German service and formed genocidal bands directed at defenseless Polish civilians. Children were impaled on stakes, and adults were quartered, etc. This was no "liberation of the Ukraine", as Ukrainians had voluntarily co-existed with Poles for centuries on territories which had possessed a mixture of Poles and Ukrainians for centuries, if not from antiquity.
__label__2 Love this show!: Love this show! So sad that the series is now over. I have been watching since Season 1 and this show is one of my favorites. I love Parker and how quirky she is.
__label__2 great: I love to watch this show, It Is funny as hell. There is never a moment where I regret buying it.
__label__2 I hope they return.... The "Modern Day Robin Hood's": Absolutely loved all the episodes... Each one of the group has their own speciality. Mostly learned using those gifts as criminals... but now they are like Modern Day "Robin Hood's"... They help those who can not help themselves in the way that is needed. I love all the characters and have watched all Seasons... and will miss them terribly if they do not continue the series...
__label__2 My sides hurt after reading this: I understand the point of this "sting" manuscript. However, all the serious stuff to the side, this is the funniest thing I've ever tried to read. I could only take it a few pages at a time, otherwise I started laughing so hard, I couldn't focus on the page.Anyone who has ever thought about writing or publishign a book should pick up a copy of Atlanta Nights.
__label__1 KC light covers: This item was misrepresented. It shows in the picture that the letters are small, but when we received them, the KC letters took up the entire surface. I was very disappointed, as was my son when he opened them for Christmas.
__label__2 Seems to work and smells great: I purchased this protective spray after I bought a curling wand. I only used one other heat protective spray, but I really like this one. The other spray I used made my hair feel a little sticky, but this spray is smooth and silky. It smells great, too.
__label__2 good price, better than expensive!: Okay so I have very FINE BLONDE hair, dyed, and straightened/curled/whathaveyou every day. I can't afford to not protect my breakable hear, and i can't afford to buy the products from salons.I am always trying different protectors and have had my way with fairly nice sprays. What it comes down to, once i adjusted to the way this (and frankly most...) protectors are, watery (opposed to the hairspray-like salone protection i used)its my go-to when i'm low and dont have much money. its about three to four dollars so i just stock up when i can and itll last me a fair while...for the price, and its effectablility i give it a five. I would recommend this. However, there are better out there.
__label__1 Makes my hair feel like straw: I've only bought this in stores, not on amazon & I don't care for it at all. I prefer the straightening gel which of course is nowhere to be found in stores now.
__label__2 I love it.: it's cheap, its good, it works! ive seen alot of youtubers use this product, so i decided to give it a try! it goes great, though i think i love the dove better the dove one smelled better nd left my hair smooth, not with this one though.
__label__1 Empty bottle: Im soooo angry.....I am so upset, I received the package wet, it was not well close, so i only got the bottle empty. :@
__label__2 Light and no grease!: I was really skeptical about this product. In the past I have used products like this and found that they tend to leave my hair heavy, sticky, and not manageable. However I was really suprised by this product. I used as the instructions said and some detangler and blow dried my hair. It came out just as soft as it normally would have without anything in it (but now I get the heat protection).Very impressed. Although I purchased this item at Target for about $2.99 so you can probably find it a little cheaper somewhere else.
__label__1 Hated it: Wow not sure why so many good reviews for this. It made my hair feel nasty and caked up. I won't be purchasing again. I guess everyone is different. I have dry hair to begin with and this made it much worse with a very unnatural feel to it afterwards. If you are going to buy I would look for the best price for only one bottle. I got three bottles of this crap and most of it went down the sink so that it wasn't laying around in the " crappy cosmetics abyss".Good luck
__label__1 Very dissapointed...: I normally am very pleased with sony products, but this one has been very dissappointing. It has (in the middle of the night) re-set itself to the wrong time on numerous occasions. Just this morning I fed the baby at what I thought was 4:30 am. It looked too light outside so I checked another clock and sure enough, it was actually 6:30am. My husband, who normally wakes up at 5:30 am, was late for work this morning. This has happened several times.
__label__1 NOT-radio controlled: While the unit indicated strong signal, it could not set the time automatically. The reception here is very good and it is my third radio controlled clock: the first one is from Bulova and the second one is from La Cross. Both of them work perfectly. I spent 2 (!) hours on the phone with Sony technical support, but they could not figure out what was wrong. Very dissapointing!
__label__1 Time resets to random times: I've had Sony Dream machines for years as my bed side clock, and I was excited to buy this one. What a mistake. The time regularly just jumps to a random time in the middle of the night. Because of this, I've been late to work a few times. I can not stress how disappointed I am, or discourage people strongly enough not to buy this alarm clock.
__label__1 Worst Clock Radio Ever: It's no surprise Sony discontinued this item. This is the worst clock radio I've ever owned. There are a number of problems with this item:- The radio-controlled clock-auto-adjust function does not work at all in my location.- ALL settings including time, alarms and radio presets are lost whenever power is lost.- The display is difficult to read at a distance or at a slight angle.
__label__1 Left Me Cold: I was really looking for a book on how to use Bluetooth and what the applications were. This book is written for the geek and techno junky market and not the kind of person who wants to have the latest gadgets in their home and workplace. I was really frustrated to read on and on about profiles (what?) and technical data flow charts. The screen shots were the most useful part of the book.
__label__1 Fine in Principle, Faulty in Execution: How and why the Grail translation of the Psalms found its way into the prayer of the Church disconcerts me. The rendering of Psalm 110 (Psalm 109 in the Douay-Rheims Bible), for example, is grievious. Striking at the heart of the Church's prayer (i.e., the Psalms) strikes at the heart of the Church's belief. The insipid "modernization" of the Glory Be and other traditional prayers has me scratching my head, too: who takes it upon themselves to even do this, then publish it and disseminate it among the faithful, anyway?I eventually gave up on this volume, out of frustration, and began praying the Psalms with the Douay-Rheims Bible and the Latin Vulgate, learning a little Latin as I went on. God willing, I would soon like to get the Latin Breviary.In addition, due to similar dissatisfaction with ICEL's treatment of the liturgical texts, I've purchased the 1962 Missal and begun to attend the Tridentine Mass--thanks be to God!
__label__2 Beyond inspiring: I cannot believe I am the first person to review this movie. An overwhelming story of hope in spite of unbelievable sufferering, and yet full of surprising humor. I was afraid it would be dull and heart-breaking, but I was surprised at the humor especially when the boys first come to the US.Their perspective on the US culture is very sobering and still hopeful. Everyone should see this movie especially young people. What these men have been through is beyond inspiring. It challenges me to make the most of my opportunities.
__label__1 This is the Best They Could Assemble?: I read the first tale FRUITING BODIES by Brian Lumley and thought "that was pretty good, but I hope it isn't the best tale in the book". Unfortunately it was... There are a few other good ones like FOET by F. Paul Wilson, but there is also absolute rubbish like TURBO-SATAN by Christopher Fowler. Two other hidden gems were WAKE-UP CALL by David J. Schow and AMONG THE WOLVES by David Case. I advise anyone reading this to skip this book and instead buy any complete works by any of the authors praised above.
__label__1 Dont buy from these people!: I purchased 12 cans of this product and it came from TCI I believe was the company. Five of the 12 cans were completely hardened already and I sent two e-mails to them asking what to do about it with no reply!!! Beware buying from that company they have NO customer service what so ever!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 More Harmony books...PLEASE!!: Jayne Ann has been doing trilogies - cranking out three books for a set of characters, and outside her Eclipse Bay, the first one is so good, second two suck! REALLY.However, it's with her Harmony books Jayne Ann really returns to her top form. They are fresh, funny and show she still have the magic. So STOP WASTING TIME ON JUNK and write were you show the same spark of romance and delight in the genre.PLEASE. These characters were so warm, real, sexy and loving. What you other books are missing.
__label__1 Pretty superficial examination of far right movement: Mr. Coppola seems significantly more concerned with promoting his own "bravado" for simply talking with those in the far right movement. He provides no insight into how and why the movement survives.Basically a superficial and self-promoting book of little consequence. Don't waste your time and money.
__label__1 Broken Dishes: Ok - thought after my last GREAT DEAL this looked good too. I stoped unpacking when I found a broken mug - without pieces, which means it was packed that way, most likely a return, and I would never have bought it at any price, too huge to pack and return, so I'm going to give it to charity.
__label__2 Pfaltzgraff Winner.: Beautiful everyday dishes that won't break your bank. One hundred dollars bought service for 16 people.Pfaltzgraff Naturewood 16-Piece Stoneware Dinnerware Set, Service for 4What a great birthday presant!
__label__2 Soulful Sweaty Sweet Southern Stew: Minton Sparks has cooked and conjured up a Southern word-stew that does more than just paint pictures in your mind. As you drink this concoction down you experience memories of place and family that, if you are flesh and blood, are real for you. You don't have to be Southern to understand this cd. You just have to have lived among the species human. Because "Middlin' Sisters" is, for me, about the essence, the rue, the drippings of joyful, loving, unvarnished, god awful humanity. From "Trella's Trash" to "Line Up" you'll think to yourself "I know that person...I've been to that place...that IS my family." If you've ever had a drunk uncle or an aunt you adored or a grandmother with a switch in her hand, you know "Middlin Sisters". No cd has ever made me FEEL like this one does. Minton Sparks - Lord God this woman is 100% ALIVE!! And her gift is that she makes me remember that I am, too.
__label__2 phil lives: these phil ochs cd's are like life nowadays, just keep listening to keep your soul and mind from drowning in the absurdity of the times. It's music and poetry for the thinker that will face the pain and reality of being trapped in the situation of being fodder unit for the tyrants.
__label__2 Smooth Base for Your Makeup: I'm using this primer after switching to it from Laura Geller. I find the Mercier to be non-oily and it provides a good base for other face mkeup. I wish it had a sunscreen in it though.
__label__1 Laura Mercier cosmetics: After reading fabulous reviews about her cosmetics I decided to take the plung. I purchased the primer, moisturizing foundation, and translucent powder. Personally they are not worth the $$$ and I returned them. I actually looked worse and washed out. It may work for some individuals but not me. I am going back to my Mary Kay!
__label__2 ON ALBUM NUMBER 3 ANITA BAKER DELIVERED YET ANOTHER HIT!: Not as strong her first two previous releases, but this held it's own, and still proved that she was here to stay! She had a #1 Billboard Hit with the Title Track, another #1 Billboard Hit Single with "Just Because", and the Billboard #4 Smash "Lead Me Into Love". This project included the Album Favorite: "Good Love". Although this project only had 8 Tracks, I'm pretty sure it wasn't going to kill album sells by pulling a 4th Single (Ehich could have been "Good Love"), but when everything was said and done Anita Baker had another Top Selling Gold Album!!!
__label__1 Jane Austin would be outraged: I found the story line of this book very tedious and unbelievable, however that was not the worst of it. There were so many places in the story where it seemed that the author must have been reading Pride and Prejudice as she was writing that it made the whole work ridiculous. Conversations and situations so mimicked Austin's books that it bordered on plagiarism Vert disappointing
__label__2 Breathtaking Story for East and West: Believe me, as soon as I move with the story of novel, the irresistible force dragged the reader with such strength that reader forgets who has written the novel.The major messages of this novel are to the western readers - wonderfully affectionate mothers and ever lasting friendship across genders. Both tragedies and comedies overlook each other, ultimately all the characters combine into an active group in the memory of Vasavi, go back to soil, resounding what great Tagore wrote, "Lets go back to earth", which took shape of developmental NGO, PRAGATI, which is a dream in our life, not unreasonably. Once started reading this novel, one remains breathless till the novel ends. The contour of the novel is never and no where flat, rather full of ups and downs, lovely twists and bents. Surely this novel will win hearts of many western readers who lack emotion about mother and friendship
__label__1 How...How...How Dare They?!?!?: It sadly possible to butcher an excellent musical so that it could be used only for torturing your enemies. Not one voice was correct. Especialy Valjean. So if you have an ounce of sanity please do not buy this.
__label__1 Garbage card--WHAT A WASTE: This card was a waste of $130. It won't do what most on-board sound cards do: record a mix of streaming audio & external audio. If I record an external sound source, then decide to record an internal sound coming from the PC I have to stop everything & change a setting on the (not close to being user friendly) control panel. The control panel in the manual is completly different than wha shows up in Windows 7. I am very disappointed in this and will return it.What a WASTE
__label__1 wasn,t what they showed it to be.: what can I say the pictu bushing for the complete front end, when it came just 2 bushings for one spring.
__label__1 no go: This works for me only if I take 2 dots and it will only work for a few hours then it wears off. I will keep the jar with me this semester and see if it helps on the go. Update later.
__label__2 excellent back yard solution: We've had this for almost a year. It is completely trouble free. We do set it up on a tile table, because it is small and our cluless dog walked over it (Thankfully he was unhurt). The unit puts out a nice amount of heat and extends the season we can sit outside. it is simple and trouble free to light. The cover screws down to keep rain out and the medium (I think it is vermiculite) in. I haven't taken it camping, but it would be easy to do so. Best money I've spent in a while. Highly recommended.
__label__1 D: WRONG STUFFSUPER DUPER GREAT PRODUCT, GO FOR GOLD, YOU'RE IN IT TO WIN THIS IS IT AND DO IT WELL BUY THIS ITEM! 19 WORDS TO FILL THE REVIEW WOOT! WOOT!
__label__1 Volumes: As much as I love Family Guy, I still can't understand this volume business. Thirty to forty dollars for 12-13 half hour episodes is not acceptable. Smallville and Battlestar Galactica charge that much for entire seasons composed of 20-22 one hour episodes (for seasons one and three for BSG, anyway, since I still don't understand the 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, and 4.5 crap, but I waited for the price to drop on those as well).And on top of that, the packaging of previous volumes has been done away with for the cheaper flip box. If a premium price is going to be charged, then I expect premium services.So my complaint isn't the show, which I still give five stars to, but the price and packaging. I did my usual thing of waiting and waiting and the price eventually came down, but lets be serious. Shouldn't have to do that.
__label__1 Fox is greedy: First of all, I love Family Guy from the day it premiered on Fox, but why can't they (Fox and I'm sure Seth has a hand in it too) release all 20-21 episodes per season on one volume like they did for Volume 2 (season 3). After that volumes 4-8 are all 13 episodes per volume at $30+ each. Greed is what I call it and in this economy, its outrageous. I don't know about you but I'll wait until it drops to $19.99 or less before I'll buy it. Same goes for American Dad.Oh and about the writer's strike, just an excuse to only release the 13 episodes per volume. Fox could have waited for the strike to be over and release full seasons per volume and the year the strike happened, release that season and price it appropriately for the short fall of episodes.
__label__1 Will the real Peter please stand up, straight?: So, we finally come to find out that the dolt of an idiot, Peter P. really is GAY!!That explains a whole lot about the guy, doesn't it??
__label__2 1 CD has bad quality: I am not sure why one of the 3 CDs have bad color quality - as if it is a pirate version... everything else was great.
__label__2 Pretty good: It is a pretty good episode, I have watched it a few times. I never would have expected it out of a relative of Quagmire,
__label__2 A Pearl From A Pulp Shell: I became familiar with this character totally by chance. When the paperback collection was released in the 70s, I was baited by the tag line calling him a "supernatural Sherlock Holmes". The stories are well written almost to the point of classic literature, introducing characters with a taste for excitement, a never-ending knowledge of the bizarre and an interesting sense of justice (The Corpse-Master from "the Casebook Of Jules de Grandin" is an excellent example this.) Who cares if a few of the stories were a little campy, even those tales were fun to read. Since I bought the collection in the seventies, I've lost two of the volumes to "Acts Of God" but the four survivors have remained a treasured part of my library, worthy of rereading several times.
__label__2 Very talented!!: I purchased this CD because of the song Black #3 but after receiving it I fell in love with the whole thing. I had never heard of John but glad I have now! Very heartwarming songs!
__label__2 SPORTS inflatables.: I thought they were a bargain for what I gave for them. My kids loved them and had a blast sitting in them to play video games.
__label__1 Not one of the better KW albums: Computer world, TransEurope, Autobahn, even Tour de France are well worth getting. This one really disappointed me. Didn't have what Kraftwerk is good at - this was to overly polished and boring. In my opinion. Some people may really like it.
__label__1 Poor radio reception: Under the cabinet seems to only add more static!!! Sending this back right away, my wife wanted this solely for the Radio and her stations are static whereas my little Clock radio seems to pic up the stations perfectly!
__label__2 A must for those wanting to grasp modern molecular biology.: This book is actually a readable text explaining many of the pioneering methods of molecular biology. It does get quite technical, but it does a fairly good job explaining difficult concepts with the help of illustrations. I originally used this book as a text, and keep it now as a reference when I need to recall details about a technique. For those without any science background, it may be a challenge, but if you have the interest, it would be a lot of fun. The only bad thing about the book is that it really needs to be updated, although I should note that most of the techniques described are in current use with only slight modifications.
__label__1 Junk: I have been using the PT1180 for a few years now. The cartriges are expensive and they jam. I have thrown away a few of them now worth about $50.00. I like the look of the finished product, but don't be fooled by an inexpensive intial cost. Factor a lot of wasted tape into your purchase.
__label__1 Still trying to wash the STINK off: Whew! Unlike the others below, I hadn't seen "Ghost Watcher One," but was unlucky enough to pick this up at the library. I think the only thing that works in this film (looks like it was shot on video) is the sound recording. Directing, acting, cinematography and story are all uniformly bad, along with ridiculous makeup. "The Dude" below, is one of the actors in the film as no sane person who would ever see this piece of excrement as anything other than a painfully low talented effort at filmmaking. And what's with the towel over the bedroom door??? Attention Aspiring Filmmakers: you should watch this as inspiration that you don't need an Academy Award winning script to get your movie made. It will make you feel like your Francis Ford Coppola, David Lean and Steven Spielberg all rolled into one. Wish I could write more, but I'm still trying to get rid of the stench this video left.
__label__1 Medicinal and Smells like toothpaste...: I wanted to like this product based on some of the reviews but I just can't. First, it smells like Colgate toothpaste and that's a no go for me with regard to a face balm.Secondly, it's got a stinging quality that I do not experience in products like Nivea for Men or other shaving balms I've purchased. I want to be comfortable after I shave and apply balm, not wincing in pain.I'll finish using this product because it's tolerable but I won't buy it again.
__label__2 Jury is in - He LOVES it!: Bought this as a stocking stuffer for the hubby two years ago - now he cannot live without it! This coming from a Naval Officer - not a GQ reader. He says he loves the way it makes his skin feel after a shave; he gets a cooling effect and he has noticeably fewer to no ingrown whiskers. He also likes that it keeps his skin soft. The scent dissipates very quickly; he does not want to have a lingering aroma or smell like cheap aftershave. I am putting some in my grown boys' stockings this year; I'll make junkies out of them too!
__label__1 It's not really "fragrance fee": I like the texture and the feel after applying the balm but it has a wierd smell and it's definitely not fargrance-free. So folks who are particular in buying a fragrance free balm please be aware of this. I also feel that its bit pricey compared to other non-alcohol based balms (Proraso, Musgo Real etc.,)
__label__2 not necessarily a fan but this album is remarkable: I saw They Might Be Giants live and enjoyed the show, and bought this album as a result. I have no artists or styles to compare this to but it is eclectic and a bit strange with lots of variation in style, and if you hear the same songs live they are even more so. The musicianship visible on stage is something I have seen nowhere else.
__label__2 A true classic: I just went to a TMBG concert in which they played Flood in its entirety, and was reminded what a great album it really is. Hot Cha is probably the weakest song, and it's not that bad - and it's pretty much the only song I'd even call weak. This andFactory Showroomare probably the only two TMBG albums that I would say are winners straight through (although I haven't listened to their kids albums - yet). Others, like Apollo 18 or The Else, are a mix of hits and misses, but these two just keep on delivering. And of course, this album contains Birdhouse In Your Soul, probably the single best song the Johns have recorded.If you're here because you've bought their music for your kids and are curious what their adult music sounds like, Flood is absolutely the place to start.
__label__2 The Best TMBG CD as of 1990!: This compilation of They Might Be Giants songs has all their best and most recognized hits. The neccassary For the TMBG fan! Another Great thing about "Flood" is that this songs are so good, that practically any Alternitive Rock Fan could learn to Love They Might Be Giants through this album!
__label__1 doesnt stretch at all: Contrary to the dimensions given by some reviewers, i found that you cannot stretch this cushion at all. i tried stretching it over my headset and it immediately broke into pieces.also, the seller refused to give me a refund for the sameAvoid trying to adapt this cushion to non-plantronics headsets
__label__2 They fit; they work.: There isn't much more I could say about these except they are a manufacturer's part and they work as designed.
__label__2 GREAT!: GREAT Product...GREAT Price...5 STAR ***** EVERYTHING !!! Was an absolute pleasure doing business and I will be back for more purchases I HIGHLY recommend. Thanks a MILLION.
__label__2 Plantronics Ear Cushions: They're just what I wanted. No problems replacing the old ones. Comfortable on the ears, and sound is good.
__label__1 Grizzly plug cutters: If you're looking for cheap, this is the way to go. They didn't get past the test phase in my shop. I'll keep them though, as a reminder of the non-quality products that Grizzly sells. I cannot believe they stay in business selling tools as such!
__label__2 great,but really for the hard core fan.: i have several of the 2-disc super expansion deluxe editions of his albums.the original albums on disc 1 are treasures but usually the second discs are outtakes and non-essential things that even hard core fans will rarely play.if you find a really good price,as i did for this,buy it.otherwise,a good single disc remaster will probably be all that you want.
__label__2 good stuff: I like this product. I had to buy like $2 dental floss though to get free shipping, and save like $8 -- and then they came separately packaged and on separate deliveries! Wish they'd just raise the price $2.
__label__2 A huge hit at our house!: My family (11 year old son included) loves these cereals. They are not quite as "heavy" as your typical granola, not too sweet, and the flavors are wonderful. The Amazon price is significantly less that if you purchase at your local supermarket and, although they are still pricier than typical breakfast cereal, I feel better about feeding them to my family.
__label__1 Not as good value as I thought: I liked the variety and the taste of granola overall. I didn't like the Vanilla and Hawaiian, but even those were not too bad. My main problem were the bags are very small. They are listed at 13 oz, but seemed smaller than that. My family went through them very quickly. At the current price and amount you get, I don't think I would buy this again.
__label__1 Navy Seals in Vietnam.: As if we don't have enough books about Special Forces in Vietnam, here is still another one. Dockery's writings do not have the flow, and this short book takes longer than needed. The reader gets information about some of the missions, equipment, and the Brown Water Navy. The Navy Seals did not contribute as much as the Marines and Army in Vietnam. Still we get another book about Special Forces.
__label__1 NO FUN: Purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren....This is Boring and absolutely NO FUN no matter what your age. I guess for almost $40 you shouldn't expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting. Doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it.
__label__1 Disappointed: There was no description of how much video you can record with this camera. I purchased this camera for the purpose of making videos, and I also knew it took good pictures. I wanted that feature, also, so I figured it said it takes video, so if I had a big enough memory capacity, it'll take bigger videos...wrong. It's a 3 minute limit - and I was never informed of this on Amazon. Now I've spent $150 for practically nothing. On top of that, when I got this camera, the battery kept dying, even WITH a full charge. So I had them send me another battery, which kept dying on me the same one the last one did. So I am very disappointed with how this turned out.
__label__1 Warning! This camera has a manufacturer defect!: This camera has a defect that wont let it recognize some SD cards, but it doesnt show up until after you have taken some shots. I took 50 pictures on vacation, then the camera went dead. It turns out that there was a defect which you can read about on Canon's website that causes ALL these cameras to malfunction until you download and install a patch. Buyer Beware! i lost all 50 irreplaceable vacation pictures, and you will too.
__label__2 Beautiful...: I have always used Epson perforated 4"x6" photo paper to print photographs, but since I just got the Canon S9000 printer and started using the Canon Photo Paper Pro 4"x6" borderless - I've been amazed. Compared to Epson's paper, the Canon is the closest film developed on paper! The Canon paper is smooth, shiny and the colors are vivid. Without the perforations, the paper looks like it's developed professionally. Every package comes wrapped in a clear plastic sealed bag, and inside are the 20 sheets of photo paper along with a soft tissue paper to protect the first sheet, and a hard cardboard on the back to keep the photos nice and flat.The only problem is that the surface of the Canon Photo Paper Pro is that it's easily to scratch when rubbing against other paper or your fingernail. It's not too noticable unless you look at it in an angle in the light.But overall, it's the best paper for 4"x6" photos you want to print yourself! Great quality from Canon, I'm not buying Epson paper again.
__label__2 Good safe: It works well. Small and compact. Holds my XD 45 Tactical with a tactical light equipped nicely.I do not like that it requires batteries and the buttons are very stiff. Buttons may loosen up with use.
__label__2 A Great Sturdy Gun Vault: This gun vault was exactly what I needed. Nice quality construction, Easy to open with key, or finger code. Easy to program new code. etc... I highly recommend this gun vault, BUT advise you to carefully measure your handgun (tip to tip) and compare it to the inside dimensions of the vault. Common sense I know, but give yourself some room to remove the handgun without banging it on the sides, or under the lip of the sides, or even having to finagle it out of the vault completely. I intended to place a .38 Special revolver in it, BUT the tip of grip to tip of barrel was just a tad too long. So now I either buy a new, smaller handgun, or a bigger vault! Also, there is not a 9volt battery included, so you should have one ready so you can program your new code immediately. It's a GREAT gun vault. I just didn't measure twice first.
__label__1 Safe Now Opens Itself! Very Dangerous, find something else.: Length:: 1:00 MinsI've had this for about 3 years and just found today that it will "open itself" if I induce a little vibration by pushing it along my floor. Shocking and terrifying to say the least.
__label__2 Great Safe: This is a great Safe, it is easy to program and the push buttons are easy to find in the dark with the indented finger positions. It easily fits my revolver and extra rounds.
__label__1 code: you have to enter a code by pushbuttons . i dont recomend having to remember that in an emergency would suck ..... i sent this back and got a handgun safe that scans your finger and opens...... backup key opener to...... much faster
__label__1 Inaccurate description: Product description indicated this is an "audio CD" when, in fact, it is a DVD so could not play it in the car.
__label__2 A True American Original: Paul Thorn caught me totally by surprise a few years ago as an opening act when he came out with only his guitar and voice and wrapped the whole room around his finger. I caught him a couple of years later with his full band and it was a religious experience. I have attended thousands of live shows, starting in 1970, and I would put that show in my personal top 20! This DVD, with three solo songs and the rest with his amazing band, comes as close to capturing that feeling as video possibly can. The sound quality ranks with the finest concert recordings of all time. Paul has found the ultimate blend of rock, blues, gospel, classic R&B; and country. He and this band sound like no one you have ever heard and that's exceedingly rare anymore. The DVD and bonus live CD are one the greatest values in recorded music you will ever find. You need to see this man's band live, but if you can't, buy this DVD and crank it up!-Billy Rollings
__label__2 Make the photo: I don't go anywhere with my digital camera without this and its lens. It makes the photo.The one thing that happens is you can't use the optical viewfinder, for the conversion lens blocks it.No big deal, works just great for me!
__label__2 The quintessential Cure album!: This is by far my favorite Cure record. It's the only CD that I own that I don't skip songs on...everything flows, the mood is never interrupted, and the words conjure images as clear as photographs in the listener's mind. The Cure excel musically on this record as few bands ever will, and the poignancy and wistfullness of Robert Smith's words is touching, moving and exhilarating. Behind the tapestry of instrumental genius lies a raw emotion seldom found in rock music. I recommend this CD to anyone who doesn't already own it; this is one record that makes the listener participate in the artist's vision.
__label__1 Do not order from Hastings: I'd rate this zero stars if i could. I ordered "The Cure: Disintegration" on NEW VINYL. I received a USED CD. When I called, I was told I could return the item and they would expedite the correct item to me (this is a Christmas gift and I would now receive it after the 25th). Once I went to my email to print the return label, there was a note saying they could not exchange the item and I would just have to return the incorrect item. I am very upset with this poor customer service and such miscommunication. Now my boyfriend will not be receiving this item for Christmas, and Hastings is refusing to send the correct item
__label__1 Garbage: Disintegration is right...The Cure were best when they did fun pop songs, like in the 80's and early 90's! Pop songs are what gets played on radio, and the radio is the only sure sign of what's good in music.Obviously this album doesn't get played on the radio.I took a chance with this album, thinking it would feature the "fun" rock side of Robert Smith. Alas, it's totally boring rock. I understand that The Cure wanted to try their talented hands at ethereal rock or whatever, but this stuff just drags on and on and on like a movie or something. Yes, it's very cinematic; cinematic with Smith's mopey vocals, which sound so much better when he's in a good mood. And why wouldn't the guy be in a good mood? HE MAKES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS!! Simply put, this album is too long, too brooding, and too ambitious in scope.For people in college only.TAKE CARE!!!
__label__2 amazing: I bought this CD after losing the cassette years ago, and the rediscovery of this music has been an emotional experience. Such beautiful music and lyrics, greatly underappreciated by the popular music industry. I can't get enough of this incredible CD.
__label__2 Doris Day Fan: I love Doris Day movies! Everything from Pillow Talk, That Touch of Mink, Please Don't Eat the Daisies, Send Me No Flowers, Do Not Disturb, etc, Doris is, by far, one of the best in romantic comedies. Pair her with any leading man and she nails it. Rod Taylor, James Garner, David Nivens, Cary Grant and Rock Hudson. Having these guys as her better halves was tv couple-pairing at its best.
__label__1 THIS ONE IS EVEN WORSE THAN GLASS BOTTOM BOAT. DORIS DAY AND ROD TAYLOR.: THIS one is the 1960's DUMB BLONDE, PAMPERED WIFE movie. Doris Day is married to Executive Rod Taylor. HE works all the time--SHE hangs around the mansion with nothing to do except dress up (A spectacular wardrobe is the THIRD STAR). I think this one is PRETTY BAD (except for HER WARDROBE). Stuff happens, but most of it is DRIVEL--not even worth mentioning.I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS. Good is good. Bad is bad. THIS ONE IS BAD.
__label__1 This cd had the right idea, but somehow failed: My interest in Michael goes back to the mid 80's, when he first went out on his own. I have most of his cds and really enjoy his voice. The concern I have for this cd as well as his other cds is material content. Michael usually does't choose the songs that I enjoy listening to. He chooses a repertoire that is not necessary the big hits of yester year. One thing i'm certain of is that Michaels' voice always sounds good on all songs.With the voice of Michael on the so called great songs, I think that he would have one great cd after another. Perhaps he should take my suggestion and try this new approach to song selection. There's really nothing to loose and a lot of gain.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd.
__label__1 Good stuff, but....: The Bible quizes and outlines are excellent, but I have a problem with this book. This book suggests that people should read from the New Revised Standard Version Bible which is known as the "Gender Neutral Bible." Some liberal churches use this for text during services. It suggests reading from translations that have problems with them. I am a person that is King James only.
__label__1 Don't waist your money: While the Fire Dancer is a great product (it works great and we love it), this Fire Pit for the Fire Dancer is complete garbage. Rarely have I felt so ripped off.The cast plaster stones don't look even close to stone, but I guess it's a good thing they aren't as there is nothing to hold them together (aside from gravity) and it might be even more annoying to put them back together after they fall apart from being slightly bumped.I would also think as they are just cheap plaster casts, one might actually be able to make them fit the product they were made to surround... But they don't. There's about a half inch gap all around where you can see through to the cheap legs the thing uses to prop up the Fire Dancer in the middle.Don't throw your money away. Don't buy this.
__label__1 JavaScript Complete Concepts and Techniques: I have been working with this book for several weeks now...sorry to say the title is very misleading. "Complete"? Maybe in concept only! The Shelly Cashman Series is usually very good, but the proofreaders were WAY overworked with this one. There are several errors in the tutorials that make it VERY frustrating to use if you are just learning JavaScript. I find the code testy enough without sloppy work on the writer/editors/proof-reader/publishers 's part. I have spent HOURS to get the tutorials to work, in some cases just having to cut bait. Folks at the publishers, take this one home and try it out. I'm tempted to send you back my corrected book with the multiple errors that I have found. Fix the mistakes and try it again. Gentle readers, this one is ONE TO AVOID.
__label__1 Book was written for Windows 95: There are many complaints about this book, but what people need to realize is that this book was based on someone coding Java on a Windows 95 machine! Page 1.8 shows the program list, with some Win 95 programs. Now that most people are coding on Windows 7, how can this really be relevant? They need an updated version that fits with computers we use today. Page 5.22 shows ancient computers in a shopping cart. I know the basics haven't changed much, but come on: saving on a floppy disk?!
__label__2 Great Fun---Glad It's a Series: I happened upon this series by accident, and a lucky accident it was. I've been reading the books in order. The series doesn't disappoint and I thought this book was the best so far. There's an immaculate confection (no, it's not Doug Flutie with icing,) skullduggery in the vestry, a maybe miracle, and a developing romance. In addition to the central mystery, each book also contains the main character's wonderfully horrible Raymond Chandleresque novella. The writing is clever and the language is an absolute joy and laugh-out-loud funny. Bar none, the novellas have the very best awful mile-long similes ever written.Although much of the plot involves an Episcopal Church, the story is neither preachy nor sacrilegious. The plot moves along quickly, the characters are likeable, and the stories are great fun. The price of the books is a steal. I'll probably regret saying all this because the publisher will jack up the price. Be that as it may, this is a fun read.
__label__1 Can't get through it.: Started reading Jack London lately and really like his work. This is way different from the London that I am used to reading. Very boring. No excitement. Must be another side of Jack London, but I'm not interested. Can't get past the the first four chapters. Don't think that I am going to try anymore either.
__label__1 Check your camera manual first!: Amazon lists this as the AC adapter for the Canon Powershot A510 but it is not the right one. The voltage is wrong and the plug is to big.My A510 manual lists the ACK800 as the correct AC adapter.So check your camera's manual to make sure this is the right one for you.
__label__2 Hahaha, very late review.... great working product.: Indeed, if you have a Canon Powershot you will need this AC device when you transfer pictures from camera to PC. I had mine for almost two years and it works.
__label__1 Cable is crap: We plugged this cable into our midi board and the computer only received one out of every 8 to 10 notes. We purchased a Yamaha cable and everything worked fine.But since we opened it, they wont take it back and we are stuck with a useless cable.
__label__1 Cracked!: I bought this is Kiwi. It cooks beautifully and cleans up like a dream. Too bad it cracked the third time is used it. From the other reviews, I see my experience is not unique.
__label__1 Not a good substitute: An employee at Sephora recommended this conditioner to me as a replacement for my Dr. Hauschka lip balm stick. It was around the same price range so I bought it. It leaves a white film over my lips and makes my lips peel. However, it isn't completely useless, I use Cauldie's lip conditioner to remove all the dead skin from my lips and then put my regular Hauschka lip balm on (now that I can find it at Whole Foods). I won't be repurchasing this item. It's a shame that I couldn't share a wonderful experience like everyone else had. It just goes to show you, product react differently on people.
__label__2 Good for vocab and ideas: This book is handy for those intermediate level Spanish speakers who want to increase vocabulary about certain topics. The ideas are not very sophisticated at all, but it presents ideas from different perspectives, and provides some decent vocab. I've been using it to prep for the Foreign Service Spanish exam, and it has proven helpful. It doesn't cover enough abstract ideas for the 3 level, but it gives enough vocab and grammar to help you get there.
__label__2 great music: I bought this for my song writer husband and we both love Michael Martin Murphey.The music was rally enjoyable and he is a good person to support. He does a lot of work to preserve the 'cowboy way' and land use policies in the West.
__label__2 fast shipping: excellent condition, great use for my school ager especially on those days he is without home work. I definitely recommend using supplements in addition to the material they use @ school for superior grades
__label__2 I HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM THIS BOOK!: I am currently in college taking pipe drafting courses. We use this book as our textbook along with the accompaning workbook. I find it to be very knowlegable and informative as well as well written. It explains step by step how to draw your pipes manually, using auto cad and pro-pipe as well. Illistrations are very good also. My husband has been a welder for 22 years, and now he is also taking this course with me, and agrees with my opinion. This teaches you the basics of piping it is not an indepth book on the subject. but for beginners it is outstanding I would highly recommend it to any one interested in the subject...Kathy Noland
__label__2 La La Love it: The Pixies were so irresistably cool and catchy. Doolittle sounds like it was made in some intergalactic recording studio hurdling through the solar system. Who knows what the hell "Debaser" is about but holy crap does it rock! The rest of it is just so twisted and good it would be a crime to ignore it. The Pixies may have been the last truly fresh and original band to come out.
__label__2 Surprisingly there are those, that aren&#65533;t familiar with this: Having always seemingly been compared to "Nirvana"...this does the `Pixies' little justice, as this...their best album is a far more multi-tentacled beast than anything `Nirvana' has done. First track "Debaser" is an ambitious accessible straight out the bag College Rock track that is one of those tracks that anybody who's heard the album always mentions. But it would be foolish to not equally praise their other exceptional tracks, "I Bleed" giving a gloomy take on Ironic Pop, but its the irresistibility of "Here Comes your man" that invokes images of `The Velvet Underground' at their very best...often bemused by peoples perception of their as a populist band, singer/frontman "Black Francis" Quoted as saying..."Everyone thinks the Pixies were a incredibly popular band, but we were just a Cult band". Cult band or not...they are one of the most consistently brilliant Rock/Grunge albums bands ever devised.
__label__1 i would give this zero stars if i could: I dont like the pixies at all, but this is definatly their crowning acheivement.
__label__2 Doolittle: Doolittle being the Pixies 2nd studio album and their 1989 release and the critics loved it and Allmusic and Rolling Stone Magazine gave it max score. I agree with them. This is an incredible album. Two singles were released "Here comes your man" and "Monkeys gone to heaven". The booklet is quite strange but contains all the lyrics and has a list of whom and what they play on the album. 5/5.
__label__2 PIXIES CLASSIC!!!: I really enjoy all the stuff Pixies create, and the songs of the classic DOOLITTLE are all high points in Pixies career! All the songs are great, with the classics GOUGE AWAY, TAME, WAVE OF MUTILATION, DEBASER and MONKEY GONE TO HEAVEN!!!! If you like Nirvana, you got to check DOOLITTLE!!!!!!
__label__2 American dad season #5: this show has easily become one of my favorite animated series ive watched in along time. well written and the animation is fantastic! the characters are unbelievably hilarious.
__label__2 Fast shipping!!: The book is fascinating and the shipping was incredibly fast. Received during the first week of class!!
__label__2 So glad I found this!: I've had this on cassette for years, but about a month ago, my old cassette player ATE my cassette! So I went on a search for the album on CD format--found a new one for a LOT of money. So what a thrill to find it "fulfilled by Amazon" at a great price for a used CD. I've never bought a used CD on line before, but I trust Amazon, so I added it to my most recent order. I am THRILLED to have these songs back again. I don't always like Linda Ronstadt, but the songs on this album, especially w/ Aaron Neville, are awesome. The actual CD case was slightly scratched, but well worth it to save over $20! And the CD itself looks & plays like NEW! Thanks Amazon
__label__1 Bad Rheingold Mastering: I had looked forward to this set esp. after the wonderful work Archipel had done with their mastering of the Knappertsbusch 1952 Parsifal and Meistersinger. However, the Rheingold suffers from the same terrible remastering that afflicts their 1953 Forza remastering. On headphones the voices are all shoved over to one side with the orchestra on the other and there is artificial reverb added - I understand the last three operas are better but I didn't bother . A disappointment.
__label__2 If you love Zelda....: If you love Zelda this record is for you. It's music directly from the game so if you want to learn the songs then its perfect. If your a causual fan it is definitly not for you.
__label__2 This cd is awsome!!!!: If you loved the music from the Majora's Mask game you'll LOVE this cd! It has every song in it totaling to 112 tracks!!!The only downside is it only runs through the song once. Other than this cd rocks!! If your a zelda fan this is a must buy!!!
__label__1 Transform is dissapointing.: Powerman 5000's relase of Transform is definatley one of the most dissapointing relases. All the good stuff about PM5K (the sci-fi themes, space suits, the nice vocals) have all gone away, and turned into just anothers simple alt band. PM5K should have relased anyone for doomsday, because we would have different to listen to that sounds like what PM5K should song like, other than the amazing Tonight The Stars Revolt. I am PM5K fan, and I hope they don't continue going down this road on the next albums.
__label__1 Enjoy: I purchased this album after hearing a (1) song from it. The songs in this album are both new (to me) and (old classics). All of the music is compelling and exciting. You can listen, dance or exercise to the music and none of the songs are boring or lacking in an rhythm that makes you want to move.
__label__1 Doesn't work with cable tv: This unit only works with DirectTV, it does not allow you to integrate cable or air tv with the same system. Seems pointless if you want to be able to record multiple programs from both sources.
__label__1 Don't buy: When I bought the Tivo set I thought it was great and really enjoyed all the features. But now after just 4 month the modem in the Tivo set is broken, which means it can't dial into the program guide etc. anymore. this means Tivo is pretty much useless. I thought this should be not a big deal until I found out [what it costs to] send in the set to Philips (plus shipping). Just to repair the modem!!! I get a whole new set for that price! Besides the fact that Philips seems to have a problem with their customer service (the average hold time is 45 minutes - I tried it every day during the last 2 weeks). Tivo is great if it works but the machine itself seems to have some mechanical problems that they need to fix before I will buy a set again. If you buy it, just buy it with a warranty.
__label__2 TIVO changed our TV watching life: The TIVO is a terrific product that immediately changed the way my wife and I watch the tube. We got the 30 hour model. Setup was a bit time consuming and required a trip to Radio Shack for some additional cables, but the instructions are detailed and easy to follow.There are four or five shows we like to watch weekly and we are now free to see them at our leisure. Too tired to watch ER or Saturday Night Live? Need to go to a school meeting on Wednesday night but don't want to miss West Wing? Want to watch Seinfeld reruns? No problem. Watch them when you like. And the pause feature is fantastic. Make yourself a sandwich; Take the call from your mother. The show is waiting for you when you return. We now rarely watch live TV because TIVO has recorded other stuff we'd rather see than the usual dreck. You'll never need to watch another annoying commercial. We LOVE this thing! Great remote control, too.
__label__2 Evolve or Dissolve!: To anybody who feels that metal should stay stagnant in their progress of their evolution should then stay with Linkin Park, Trapt or Godsmack. If you do you won't ever be disappointed. For those of you who take great pride in watching some of your favorite bands take the next step in musical progress should then take a hardy bite out of this album. Coined with the category "Math Metal" by Chad Grey this band is as distant from Nu-Metal as Tool or Deftones as I have heard it described by some. This album blends the raw vocals and unpredictable time signatures of "LD50" with the melody of their follow up album "The End of All Things to Come" and then pushed the envelope a little more. Mudvayne is much more polished and for that I commend them. And also for that they are a much superior band than they used to be. So get your @$$ moving and pick up this album. You won't be disappointed!
__label__1 World owes you recognition, but you owe yourselves progress.: It's trite to re-interpret the title into the critique, but I can't help regarding `Lost and Found' as all too fitting. The best aspects seem like B-sides, while the other two thirds remind the world why radio-potential metal has become so disposable.And Mudvayne is supposed to help us forget.It's painful to imagine that they've hit a creative wall, worse to conceive that they would weaken themselves so as not to intimidate promoters, but I hear those riffs that were worn out 20 years ago and I just don't know. The experimental sharpness is still floating around in here, but it's measured with points rather than an edge.Gather the mob-funds, guys. But come back and remind us how much more you have to give.
__label__1 The smell made it unusable for me: Let me say that I'm a John Frieda fan. I use the Frizz-Ease hair serum on my thick, curly hair every day and it works wonders. So I was prepared to like this product.I'm not very sensitive to product scents; I will use most anything if it makes my hair look good. This one is an exception, though. It smells terrible -- to my nose it's a combination of watermelon, dead fish, and baby powder -- and the smell does not go away as the product settles and dries. I couldn't even give this a second test try because it smelled so bad. It did make my hair shiny, but there is no way I could possibly use it. Bummer! I see that a couple other reviewers have liked it, though, so it's definitely a subjective matter and not everyone would find the smell so objectionable.
__label__1 Tune Out This Book: Sorry, but if you want to broadcast for more than a few feet, this book is not for you. This book is a collection of low-powered simple circuits, backed with high-powered marketing. The back cover states, "Now that the FCC has changed the laws governing pirate radio and video stations...." While there is now a low-power FM service, for which a type-accepted transmitter and license are still required, there have been no "changes" governing pirate broadcasting. It's still illegal (and fun). And there is nothing in this book that is going to save you "thousands of dollars" over commercial equipment, while giving you the same power and performance. These statements are clearly misleading and get your hopes up (and your wallets out) for something this book is not. It's unfortunate that the author, who is probably capable of doing so, did not write a book to match the promised content.
__label__1 Don't bother: To be frank, I found this trilogy so be the absolute worst book that I have ever read (it was an omnibus). The 'hero' spent most of his time whining, and making everyone else suffer along with him. The writing was well done, but the plot and characters were hopeless. Don't waste your time plowing through it...
__label__1 Like wading thru cold maple syrup: I will say that Donaldson's settings and concept were unique at the time of this series's conception. It might even be said that he revitalized an ailing genre with his well thought out epic. But be warned; this novel will leave intellectually spent. Covenant is perhaps the most indecisive, whiny fantasy "hero" I've ever read. I find him thorougly dislikable. He's the kind of guy you don't ask "how ya doing?" because he'll take an hour telling exactly what's wrong with his life.
__label__1 Didn't Like it: Tried this book on a recommendation from my brother. Found it really stupid and kind of arrogant in the use of language, like he was trying too hard to impress you with obscure words (and I like to think I have a pretty good vocabulary). Kind of like he swallowed a thesaurus and borrowed other peoples stories besides. Read the whole thing, but have no desire to read any more of the series. Main character too angry and couldn't seem to get over it. Wore me out.
__label__1 Beware...a Hero that wines and is unsepathetic: I read this book some years ago and just thinking about it to write this review pains me. It's like trying to remember how it felt to have a stainless steel spike driven thru your skull.The "Hero" is annoying, winey and while reading this book, I longed for his death or disappearance. The book is a slow, hard read. If your thing is reading about people you'd never want to run into/ know (and that's our "Hero"), then this book is for you!How this book has had a run as a series of books is beyond me. The story has no appeal to me. I can't identify with the main character and it's a horrible read. Honestly, I wish I had never read it. You have been warned!
__label__2 A Beautiful Epic of Tolkien Proportions: Donaldson's Thomas Covenant books are masterworks of creative joy, frustration, and eventually triumph. Both the frustration and triumph stem from the intricacies of a complex anti-hero whom the reader will alternately want to curse and salute. The first book, Lord Foul's Bane, is not without flaws, and it does begin slowly as others have noted, but the committed reader will be rewarded with an epic of Tolkien proportions and a world which is painful to depart once the last page is done. I have returned to this series many times over the years, and it holds a place of honor in my collection.
__label__2 First-class science fiction fantasy: Stephen Donaldson's Thomas Covenant isthe only books I've read THREE times.A fantastic story, with great depth.If you like Tolkein, this is a must-read
__label__2 Great book: Received this book super fast - which was great since I needed to read it for my class.The book was in perfect condition!
__label__2 A Great Addition: My experience with this book was certainly different from that of the reader above. I loved the book. I have referred to it many times and have tried many of the ideas. I recommend it completely, and I am plan on buying 103 as soon as I can.
__label__1 Wrong Book: I was sent the wrong book. Then he claimed he sent the right one that I never recieved. He refunded my money but I am frustrated!
__label__2 An excellent album: This is a great album. There is a breadth of tone and subject matter, though all the songs come from Billy Bragg's perspective, and are quite political in nature. To specifically address one criticism on this site, Billy did not write a new tune for 'The Red Flag', he states that he is returning the lyrics to their ORIGINAL tune, which is a lively Irish reel; the effect is to give the song the energy and enthusiam it requires.
__label__1 Hymns to holocaust: Bragg has always been abysmal as a singer/songwriter, but recording the anthem of a political movement that killed millions around the globe is in bad taste--even for pop music. Crank it up, comrades, and blast back to the era of the gulags, that era you love so well.
__label__2 Works with Mac G5: Works with a Mac G5. Drivers installed without problems. The USB jack needs to be plugged in directly to the Mac though, or a powered usb hub. Otherwise, the Mac fails to see it. Running OSX 10.3 dual 2.5Ghz.I wish it came with a rack mount adapter instead of purchasing separately.
__label__1 Everything but ...: The Sony CD clock radio almost has everything I was looking for. A CD player. Easy use of both alarms. The ability to set both alarms to the radio (this sounds simple, but many CD clock radios (Timex, Panasonic) allow a sound source to be associated with only one of the alarms). Good sound. Very good looks. But unlike most clock radios, it does not have a battery backup. As my area periodically gets short blackouts, this is needed. Especially since getting to work depends upon it. If you do not need the backup, go for it. Otherwise, look elsewhere.
__label__2 My first computer generated deck and... I love it!: At first I was pretty sceptical when I saw some pics of it on aeclectic.net but last year, I discovered the German version of the deck at my local book shop and I fell immediately in love with it. As I am a tarot reader and collector, I have some decks and always refused incorporating a computer generated deck in my collection but I had to have this deck. I use it for my personal readings and I am always amazed how it "clicks" with me. I got some very interesting insights with this deck.I also like the book as it tells about local British myths and lore but I would not recommend it for absolutely tarot newbies. You have to have quite a bit of background knowledge.
__label__1 You're kidding right?: This music is very weak.If you know your Jazz then you will look to Carla Cook--the only Max Jazz artist worth your time--believe me.
__label__1 Not as good as I hoped: Although the product was definitely better quality than the valve I replaced, it definitely did NOT provide 100% flow shotuff. It wasn't even close. The remaining flow is significantly more than dripping and closer to a weak stream. It does REDUCE the flow, but certainly does not shut it off.
__label__2 Works just fine: Easy to use and adjusts water supply as advertised. As some complained, it doesn't shut off completely, but I really wouldn't want it to.
__label__1 How can people be so gullible.: In 1996 an 11-year old girl did a science project in which experienced 'practitioners' of HT were asked to detect her 'energy field' and given a 50-50 chance of guessing. The results: 44% of the time, the HT adepts were able to guess correctly. A coin flip would generate approximately 50%. This is nothing but a scam and all scientific tests have proven this fact.I would not waste 10 cents on drivel like this. If I could have given it zero stars, I would.
__label__2 Very good: I really like this book, and the three--book series, in general. Lots of good puzzles, big-enough type, etc. Small, easy to carry around, take on trips, etc. Receommend.
__label__1 Worthless Purchase: I only give this a 1 because I can't choose a zero.Whomever wrote the puzzles for this book obviously doesn't know the rules of sudoku:No number can appear twice within a column, row, or 9-box sub-section (nor located in the same box within the 9-box sub-section). I'm a sudoku fanatic, so I'm very versed in the rules. When I sat down and started working the puzzles, I found myself running up against instances on every puzzle where the same number would have to appear in the upper left hand box of each sub-section twice within the same puzzle (which is a BIG no-no). When this happened 10 times in a row, I went back to the answer page and discovered all of the puzzles had this defect.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!!
__label__1 Sadly, Enough's Enough: This is the ultimate Greil Marcus parody, by the master himself. Ideas like a solemn correlation between an Elvis Presley postage stamp and Clinton's election are announced without even a smirk. Coming next: KNOCKED OUT LOADED: FINDING EVIDENCE OF ELVIS AND DYLAN IN EVERYTHING AFTER FALLING DOWN AND HITTING MY HEAD.
__label__2 Delivery Problem - Turned Out Great: I added this item into an order at the last minute and forgot about it. When I remembered it a few weeks later, I sent a note to Amazon about the missing item. I was even concerned that I might have thrown it out with the packaging. I have been organizing my supplies so there was only one place this would have been found in my garage.Amazon sent me the item. Now that I have it, it is large enough that I know I did not misplace it or throw it out by mistake.I want to compliment Amazon on their customer service. It gives me confidence to continue to order from them.
__label__1 The non-slip material sticks to soft leather: I bought this to protect the soft leather in the Acura TL I bought my wife.The Material they use on the seat facing side came off on the leather.Trying to clean it caused damaged to the leather.Could be due to high temperatures in California.I would think the problem is less of an issue with thicker leather seats like the ones BMW uses but back seat of my Acura TL is now in need of serious attention due to use of this product.
__label__1 Deeply Disappointing (sooo glad I only rented it): I was so disappointed with this film: the acting was second rate at best, the greatest offender being the scene with woman at the well (John 4). The ongoing interaction with the Jewish leaders was utterly painful to watch. I remember being so excited about this film, I thought about buying it even before watching it. So glad I only rented it. Believe me, I had heard so many positive things about the film, it made finally watching it even more disappointing. Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" and the recent "The Nativity Story" are so superior in production value, with the finest movie on the life of Jesus Christ remaining Franco Zeffirelli's "Jesus of Nazareth." I'd certainly recommend these over "The Gospel of John."
__label__2 Great video!: The best video concerning any gospel that I have ever seen. Stays strictly with what the gospel says and no personal interpretations.
__label__2 Wow: Love the dvd. Henry C is perfect as Jesus and the biblical account of John is spot on the bible. No "Hollywood" embellishments in this area. the video leaves you feeling like you've witnessed Christ first hand and its very peaceful and satisfying. Buy this!
__label__1 What they don't tell you: Unfortunately this product was not labeled for use in the US only. I cannot view the DVD in Australia. So 'buyer beware'. What a rip off. I had to give it one star because the system would allow none.
__label__2 What better a witness then the WORD itself: I like the Movie because it is not common to see far straying from the WORD, yet it is drawn from the Alexandrian texts which are gnostic, droping many words, and even entire verses (compare NIV 1John 5:7 to NKJV or KJV). Another thing Isaih said the real LORD was not comely (handsom), nor did he have any form (was not well built). Also Mary Magdeline near the end, gets a lot of camara time for some reason, and keeps acting fluttery. All in all I would watch it several times without feeling like I was wasting time, because any of HIS words are enriching.Praise the LORD Jesus, HE has"magnified HIS WORD above HIS NAME" Psalm 138:2b,"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." Romans 10:17,JESUS is alive, HE is risen, HE healed my broken heart, and gave me a new life in HIM.
__label__2 The BEST: This is the best Jesus video I have ever seen in my life! It comes in two DVD's, the full length and a shorter one. The man playing Jesus was an actor on LOST. He does a truly inspired portrayal of Christ and you have no problem relating to Him.
__label__2 SUPERB FILM: THIS IS THE ONLY BIBLICAL BASED MOVIE THAT IS ACTUALLY ACCURATE WORD-FOR-WORD TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURE. HENRY IAN CUSICK IS PHENOMENAL AS THE MESSIAH; HE IS THE BEST ACTOR CAST AS JESUS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE DIRECTING IS AMAZING AND CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER AS NARRATOR IS PERFECT. I PERSONALLY WATCH THIS MOVIE ON A REGULAR BASIS, IT IS TRULY THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL BROUGHT TO LIFE.
__label__2 Wonderful: I watch this often on quiet Saturday afternoons. It is one of my favorite depictions of the Bible story. I recommend it.
__label__1 How large (or small) is it.: I looked around the net and NOBODY gives the weight of this item. I really love cheddar popcorn but will NOT buy an unknown quantity!
__label__2 I Can't Believe It Came From Memphis But Then Again I Can: This is a very pleasant collection of songs from a young Memphian I can only call "ultra-modern". I live in Memphis. I know Memphis is mostly about Elvis, Sam and Dave, Al Green, Sam the Sham, Carla and Rufus Thomas, Booker T and the MGs, Charlie Rich, Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Three Six Mafia, all sorts of rockabilly and soul and gutbucket and rap. But this is really great, too, in a completely different way, more like Big Star and Alex Chilton when he's not really angry and bitter. This is ethereal and damn near giddy music... it's intelligent, rooted in 60's white pop with a carefully crafted psychedelic edge. It floats along, pulls you in and...well, it makes you feel happy. It's ultra-modern -- nobody else sounds like this -- and it's very smart. I can't wait for the follow-up. I'm the Big Oh and I gotta go.
__label__2 A virtuoso's best work.: The guy was a friggin' magician on the guitar. This disc covers so many styles but nonetheless remains tightly knit and cohesive. Country licks, blues, twang, rockabilly, jazz and the Simpsons theme. A superb recording. Serious, fun, deep, shallow. C'mon and dig it.
__label__2 Hillerman is getting better again.: I used to enjoy Hillerman, but the last few books before First Eagle and Fallen Man left me feeling that he had run out of material. Well, even if he's stealing stuff from John McPhee, I really enjoyed Fallen Man, and I think he's getting even better with First Eagle. I enjoy a good knotty plotline and both of these books deliver. One more note, quite frankly, I never really could stand Janet Pete. Chee needs to stop moping and go after Bernie.
__label__1 I eagerly anticipated this book and was disappointed.: This book was not up to the standards I have come to expect in Tony Hillerman's Chee and Leaphorn series. The plot was convoluted and yet uninteresting and formulaic. Chee and Leaphorn in previous books had appealing personal characteristics. In this book, all the characters were ho-hum.
__label__1 worst acting ever.: i'm only 15 minutes into this film and i'm finding it hard to keep watching.this is quite possibly the worst acting/directing i've ever seen in a movie.
__label__2 WOW: This album is absolutely amazing! You can listen to the first ten seconds of "Donna Lee", right from the opening hit of the drums, through to the beauty of "Forgotten Love" and realize this is some pretty hot stuff!Best tracks are "Continuum", "Portrait Of Tracy", "Okonkole Y Trompa" and "Forgotten Love". "Kuru/Speak Like A Child" ain't bad either.The bonus tracks are alright, but the general album is more interesting.In my opinion, one of the most accomplished works by one of the most accomplished, if not the accomplished player of all time!
__label__2 I dig this.: I knew what I was getting when I picked this up, pretty much your standard random-members-band with random vocalists and Paul Di'Anno the man himself from the first two Maiden albums. This is good, not absolutely earth-shattering, but that's not the point of these things, as they are tributes by artists who love the band. I gotta say that so far, the Steve Grimmett tracks have to be my favorites, he even comes close to Bruce Dickinson's greatness at times. Di'Anno's, while great, seem to be lacking something in the delivery, but that just might be the fact that he's older than he was when he originally recorded them. Then there's Bernie Shaw singing "Fear of the Dark" which was great to me because I'm a huge Uriah Heep fan and he definitely brings some of that spirit to the song. All in all, a pretty standard tribute, definitely recommended to all Maiden fans!!!
__label__1 buyers beware: Even though these filters are identified as "SKUTTLE filter part #448-1", they are not manufactured by Skuttle. Genuine Skuttle filters have 22 pleats; these generic filters only have 17.
__label__2 Good for heel spurs: This is the second pair I've bought. I have heel spurs on both feet and these shoes are soft enough on the back to not put a strain on the spurs. I use them for work and they hold up to the 8-12 hours I'm on my feet, I placed my orthotics on top of the insole so thay might be why.The Navy color looks drab grey after washing so I don't recommend that color and I haven't washed the glossy black I have yet. I may not wash them because they can be wiped clean.
__label__1 Wish I had kept the box to return them in...: These shoes run large, and are not as comfortable as described. I wouldn't dare wear these for work. They are large/loose in height and length, but still narrow in the front just behind the toe box. I've bought much better, much more comfortable footwear for less money than these shoes cost.I like the color and texture of the material, but don't know how they will look & feel after washing. They look OK, but they feel cheap on my feet, and I won't buy another pair. I wish I had returned them, but thought that if I bought better insoles they would be comfortable, but they really aren't, and I have to wear extra thick socks with these although I still need to stretch them behind the toe boxes. I regret that I threw out the box and cannot return them. They are a waste of my money.
__label__2 A great show!: I love Law and Order and will purchase all 20 seasons at some point. The rip from the headlines stories are so true. I love the show and hope you do too.
__label__1 Disappointed: Sorry to say that I'm disappointed with these headphones. I have purchased headphones from V-Moda three times before and they've been 100% awesome. But these latest headphones, the cord is cheap and gets tangled very easily. Very irritating. I do not recommend.
__label__1 Great Sound BUT Poor Durability: Rich highs and deep lows sound great BUT NOT IF THE CABLES FALL OUT Of THE BUDS AFTER 3 WEEKS of routine use!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh
__label__1 Epidemic lack of quality please read the reviews before buying!!: These headphones look great and sound quality is great. But mine lost sound in the left ear after 2 weeks! That is completely unacceptable. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. Apparently this happens with great frequency. Save $50 and much aggravation and check out the Sony Fontopia's. Those lasted me a year which prior to this was dissapointing. I spent the extra money for increased durability and was completely wrong. You don't get what you pay for. Avoid V-Moda like the plague!
__label__2 For their price, these are a great deal!: The V-MODA Vibes are a nice little set of headphones. I use them with my Creative ZEN and they sound great! They don't sound quite as good as the higher end (Ultimate Ears or Shure), but good for the money. They are a tiny bit thin on the Bass, but better than most in their price range. If you need more bass, check out the V-MODA Bass Respone phones.They do need a "burn-in" period though to reach their capability.
__label__1 Scratchy Scratchy Scratch Scratch: Okay so I had pretty high expectations for this product, because of the many reviews it got and how awesome these looked. It was very deceiving, when I got home and popped these out, plugged them in I was sooo disappointed with the highs on in the headphones. It was very scratchy every time something not even that high would be playing...The lows were good BUT they do not make up for the highs. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES UNLESS YOU ONLY LISTEN TO MUSIC WITH JUST LOWS.
__label__1 Amazing for about 3 months: When I first received them they sounded amazing, loved every bit of them from their looks to the sound. I used it fairly actively ran a lot with it walked everywhere with them on etc.Now first thing to go was the metal sleeve on the 3.5 connector, it was sliding off and whatever no big deal this happened about a month in. Then the next thing to go was my left ear buds insulating wire, exposing it slowly, still worked fine but it was slowly dieing, then near the connector the insulation broke there too exposing the wire. Then the right earbud's wire was exposed then the left one stopped working altogether. That's when I got new earbudsOverall, i wouldn't buy these again, almost got tempted since i noticed it had a different design on the connector so i thought maybe they got better, but this time i'm gonna heed other peoples reviews and still not get them.
__label__1 They didn't even last me TWO months!: I bought these on June 6, 2009 and they gave out on me two nights ago (August 19, 2009)! One of the ears just up and stopped working! I have to constantly adjust the wiring just so that the dead ear bud can come back. What's the point of this high grade wire protector if they're just going to give out anyway!? And at $50+ I expected much more from this...FAR more. AT LEAST a year...if they had lasted me at least a year then I'd at least be satisfied with my purchase, but sadly that was not the case. Cheap non-name brand ear buds from CVS lasted me longer than these things! Avoid these, people. Lest you want to suffer the same frustration I experienced. I'm going to try and see if I can't get a new or refurbished pair from the manufacturer. This shoddy overpriced merchandise cannot go on like this!
__label__1 Good sound, Bad quality: I bought the red version of these earbuds in January 2008 after tons of research. A lot of the negative reviews I read were about the earbuds shorting out. In my case, after about 2 months, I noticed that the left earbud was now playing at a MUCH reduced volume. At first I thought it was just the stereo mixing of music, but then I realized that, indeed, the volume and bass coming from the left ear bud was very quiet, and now it annoys me to listen to. A couple of months in and I'm SOL - especially since I bought them for $65 on Amazon without a warranty. Splurge for buying them from the manufacturer so you can get them repaired.PROS: Sounds good, look great, easy to get in and out of ears (compared to Shure).CONS: They are already shorted. :(
__label__2 Very nice: I was searching for some ear buds to replace the standard iPod issue. I got a pair of Shure e2c's for Xmas and have never been able to get them to fit my ears no matter what fitting I used. After much experimentation I was able to get some of the foam fittings to work but the sound was still lacking. No bass at all. After doing some reading I decided to take a chance on the V-MODA Vibes. At first I was a little concerned they might be to bassie. Well, that is not the case. The bass is definitley there but it's not overwhelming by any means. So far I like the V-MODAs a lot. I was able to wear them right out of the box - I haven't even tried any of the other fittings. Plus they're not as clunky as the Shures. The smaller size enables me to fit almost the entire bud in my ear. I am quite pleased with my purchase. Anyone interested in a slightly used pair of e2c's?
__label__1 Great sound, poor durability: First of all these earbuds sound great. However, after only six months the wire near the earbuds started to tear away. I sent them back for a new pair almost a month ago, and they still have not shipped the new pair. Great sound but poor durability and terrible customer service.
__label__1 Extra Noise: One of the worst purchases I have made. The cords to the earbuds are fabric covered and rub against clothing, creating load rubbing background noise that is high decibel and louder than the music being delivered. I have to binder clip them to my collar to get them to be acceptible. Hate them.
__label__2 Great sound...but be sure to save receipt: Title says it all. Left channel/bud started to fade after 3 months of use. Never used earphones with ipod in pocket, so bending of cord was unlikely cause of fault.That said, Vmoda stood behind their product, and provided a quick exchange via mail with proof of purchase.Big picture: Tremendous value and sound. Earbuds are great for passive noise reduction of piped guido music at health club and aircraft noise.
__label__2 Better than average: While they look excellent,being metal and shiny,it all comes to soundThey are a type of sound that is very smooth laid back yet detailed.They also have excellent low end bass, not boomy or bassy but deep amd large.There is no listener fatigue from extendid listening of the music,The only fault I could place is a slight lack of brightness I am used to.so key words here are:smooth, detailed, laid back, good bass
__label__1 ftoo ragile: The voice from right-hand earbud becomes much lower than the other 1 month after I got it.
__label__1 V-MODA Vibe Earbuds: I have used earbuds and headphones extensively for years. I found these to be well made, sized well and comfortable. The sound quality is good but so bass bias it sounded very unnatural listening to my IPOD. I returned them to Amazon and received a prompt refund.
__label__2 good buds: good base. i dont feel they are base heavy.the only problems i have:i lost the carrying case with the replacement tips along with it.you can hear the cable moving around when you are wearing them.i want to try the foam tips they sell but they are a bit expensive.they bothered me at first because i wasnt used to having the buds in the canal. u get used to it.i would try a different brand for my next pair.
__label__2 Good sound, but not as noise insulating as I hoped: I bought these primarily to use on my commute. I had read they were great at insulating outside noise. I ride a very noisy public transit train in the SF Bay Area and these earbuds really don't block out enough sound. The train wheels just scream on the tracks in some sectinos. These are comfortable and the sound quality of the music is good but if you are looking for something to insulate outside noise, these won't really do it.
__label__1 Great looks, sub-par performance: I purchased these headphones twice. The first time was in summer 2008. The headphones were awesome. However, they crapped out after about two months. I returned them and went with a cheaper set of headphones.I was craving some nice headphones, and I saw the price on these is substantially down from 2008, so I bought them again (spring 2010). Big difference! The external looks are the same, but build quality is down and the sound quality and in-ear comfort is way down. These are headed back to Amazon for a refund.
__label__2 Great Purchase: We recently purchased a touch free trach can thru Amazon. the product is great. It is easy to use and you don't touch the trash can. A wonderful product. the price was outstanding, we had priced similar products upwards of $100, we were able to geet the trach can thru Amazon for less than $50.
__label__1 Works great, BUT.....: The touchless operation of this trash can works great. Easy to attach and remove trash bag and secure ring to keep bag in place. BUT, the sensor that raises the lid is too wide of range. Walk by within 2ft and lid opens, runs battery down quickly. Have gotten in habit of turning off, except will doing food prep for period of time. The function of no touch use 24-7 was what I was looking forward to. Turning on/off for most of daily use defeats the no touch perk.
__label__1 useless.: I HATE spending money on BAD products, and this was a bad product! My husband and I used it for a couple months and it already broke. We sent it to the factory for repair, but the same problem happened AGAIN after a few months! Now we don't even use it.
__label__1 A mind of its own after five months of use: It was alright at first. Now the lid will open at its own will or not at all even two set of new batteries were changed.
__label__2 Best trash can ever: This trash can was purchased to replace a round stainless steel trash can. Not only did it meet our expectations but they were exceeded. The hands-free mechanism works extremely well and the can holds more than we ever imagined. The fact that odors stay inside is an added bonus. Worth every penny!
__label__2 So far so good!: This trash can is classy looking, matches well into a stainless/black kitchen, and so far (one month in) has worked great. The size is just right for a kitchen. The sensor takes about 2 seconds to register before opening the lid, while I'd prefer a little more immediate response, but oh well. Overall, a very cool addition to my kitchen. If it goes bad, I'll come back and update the review.
__label__1 electrical problem: The itouchless trashcan you sent me had some electrical problem. Both powerr sources (batteries and AC adapter) did not work. Power did not come to the trashcan.I mail to the Customer care, but i was told that a warranty does not apply to Japan. At present, I am using the trash can without power.
__label__1 This garbage can is GARBAGE: Length:: 1:07 MinsLook - this thing doesn't work anymore. This claim, "if you open your can 20 times a day, it can last over 10 years. This could actually be the last trashcan you ever buy, which will save you money, mess, and time." is an OUTRIGHT LIE. This garbage can lid worked for about 15 months at best. It no longer opens wide enough to put trash in, and the lid only stays up for a second, if that. Totally useless, overpriced terrible product.
__label__1 The lid stopped working within 6 months.: After comparing step cans and prices at Wal-Mart, Kohls, Amazon and eBay, I found this can for $35 at Costco and went for it. We all loved it, it was so convenient! The infrared sensor was iffy, sometimes it doesn't respond, but I had no problem pushing the open button, which worked fine to me. After 6 months though, the lid won't open either with the open button or the infrared sensor. Fresh batteries notwithstanding, I have to dig my fingernail under the lid to open it. Sure, the close button still works, but shouldn't I expect that my garbage can should outlive my garbage?Thank goodness I bought this at Costco, I can return it for a full refund even after 6 months. I'm going to get a reliable and durable step can and skip the $10 of batteries altogether. Good idea, but unreliable technology makes this a loser in the end.
__label__2 Saves clean up and time!: I have found this trash can to be a real time saver. First, it has a large opening which prevents spills and other messes. Secondly, because it opens automatically, I spill less and do not dirty the can by touching it constantly. I have had one for two months and am pleased with the performance. Use regular kitchen bags. Getting the kitchen bags in isn't the simplest task, but it does hold the bag in well. Cleans easily. I would recommend.
__label__1 What's up with this sensor?: It's interesting that we have recently started experiencing the same problems that others are commenting on. Our sensor has stopped working all together. We have done everything that others say works (replacing batteries, unplugging the cord - which we had to buy separately - and cleaning where the sensor is located), yet this trash can will not work.If you are looking at purchasing this item, please PLEASE read all the comments here first. This device has a very short lifespan - typically a month.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: Bought this last week. I'm really not sure how this product gets 4 stars from others - it's a piece of junk. Right out of the box, the lid does not close all of the way. I wind up having to press the 'close' button several times. I've tried the "leave the batteries out" trick to no avail. Don't waste your money, and don't believe the other positive reviews. This product is, well, trash.
__label__2 touchless stainless trash can: I have had this trash can for 3 years. Absolutely amazing! It finally died after 3 years of everyday use. highly recommend! Loved it! No problems whatsoever.
__label__2 Stainless Steel Garbage: I purchased this garbage, one, because I wanted the largest sized stainless steel garbage I could find and, two, I wanted one that looked good. With this product I received the best of both worlds. I enjoy everything about this product, it holds a lot, it looks great, and its motioned sensor opening lid is awesome. This product is by far worth every cent I spent on it. I highly recommend it to anyone. Its overall an excellent product. No complaints here
__label__1 Worked ok for a while and then.....: It stopped working....it never opens or closes properly...contact customer support 2 days after warranty ended and they refused to replace.
__label__2 Tech Home: I'm an electrical engineer and just bought a new home so I'm trying to tech it out. This is a great trash can that's perfect in size and function. Everything is working great so far and whenever my friends come over to my place they love to play with it.
__label__2 Worth for the money: My wife saw the review and arranged to get this for our lovely new home. When I unpacked the trash can, i felt it was so thin and weightless, slowly I realised that we do not need really a heavy one for this. It is so far working well and feel the importance of touchless. We had house warming few days ago, and everyone who came to the house warming asked where did you buy this. We have two kids, we thought they may play with it, but not at all. The negative aspect of the touchless is to sensitive, even if you walk near by your dress make them to open many time and secondly I feel the time limit of lid opening bit shorter. But these two negative aspect are very minor problem. I would strongly reccommend this trash can to anybody.
__label__2 Everybody Should Own One of These!: This is the greatest thing ever! The process to change out bags is slightly more involved than with our old garbage can, but this removes so many other minor inconveniences regarding trashing things...it's hardly a worry.Bag never falls into the can, perfect size for the kitchen, and even looks great! Can't imagine finding a better item at a better price...
__label__2 Best Product on Market: I bought this as a gift and was told it was the BEST gift they had ever recieved and uses it daily and recommended it to others!! I bought myself one and was so pleased as to how long the batteries lasted and how well it works, a real attention getter for company! Everyone loves it!
__label__1 Canadians - do not order!: I thought this would be a novel product to have in my kitchen. I was thrilled when I ordered it. Trash can arrived by UPS and they charged me a $36.82 brokerage fee to bring it into Canada. When I got it home, it did not work. I sent it back UPS and it cost me $73.22 in shipping. Todays Concept gave me a real hassel with the return. I never got my monies back for brokerage fees and the cost to ship it back. I am out over $100.00 on this transaction. Canadians - live and learn.
__label__1 OK until something happens - Customer Service Blows: This trashcan worked great for the first 45 day. Then it kept staying open. Got tech support that didn't fix the issue was told to mail it in. After mailing it in on Dec 8th they said that it was take about 2-3 weeks after arrival before mailing it back to me. Well it is now Feb 15, I have called 5 times and spoked w/ angela who keeps saying it is being mailed on this date or that. Oh it's sitting in receiving and will be sent today. Oh were looking into it. And so on. Will i get it back or won't I. Oh and no one will claim to be the supervisor. Go ahead call them yourselves 800-660-7978 you'll see. Isn't it pretty bad when they know 1 of x number of customers by name???
__label__1 Sensitive sensor solution: Not sure if anyone else has posted this solution, all you have to do is cover part of the sensor with black electric tape, the more you cover the closer your hand needs to be for the lid to open. Overall a great trash can, only negative besides the overly sensitive sensor is the stainless steel is a bit too thin.
__label__2 Good quality product with great look: This is a great looking trash can that works very well. I have had the trash can for a long time (about a year). It still has the same batteries and doesn't show any size of failing. This trash can is not a bullet proof tank, but it is strong enough to hold all the beer bottle you can fit in it. Like any sheet metal product it will bend if you mistreat it.
__label__2 Almost the perfect trash can: Of course, everyone thinks you are crazy for purchasing a hands free trash can but my husband and I really liked the idea. Much more sanitary. The trash can arrived in good condition. Easy to operate (once you get the hang of putting in the trash liner which is not really that difficult but you have to make sure the inner ring is in the correct position). Looks clean and neat. Space saving. The reason we didn't give it a 5 star rating is: (1) I couldn't figure out how to give it 4.5 stars; (2) the lid sometimes goes up when you walk close to it (not a real big problem for us but if you had a large family it might); and (3) it would have been really good to have the choice of an adapter so that it could be plugged in. Not real draw backs and none of these have really been a problem but items worth noting. I would order again and have recommended to friends (even those who laughed). My husband and I both love it!
__label__2 Kitchen automated trash can: Awesome - just could be upgraded by one feature:if you through stuff (eg empty coke can) towards the lid, it should open on time :-)Otherwise it's awesome and I recommended to allof my friends (they purchased alreslady it.)
__label__1 Decent, but lacking basic supplies: Works fine, but not designed for all 13 gallon trash bags. Furthermore, I was more than a little surprised when the package came without an AC adapter. Those things cost 20 cents to make, and for a $63 dollar trash can, one should have come standard.
__label__1 Lasted about 4 months: Well, it was great for the first 3 or 4 months. Then the door started opening slower and stopped at about half way. Now-a-days, the door only opens 1/3 of the way. When this first started, my first thought was to change the batteries. When that didn't work, I thought it was due to the batteries being old. So I went and bought new D size batteries. They weren't the cheap dollar store batteries. I bought Energizer batteries just to make sure that they would be full power. Sadly, this has not worked either.So 5 months ago, this trash can was a 5 star. Now it is a 2 star. Unfortunately I expect products to last at least a year before I replace them. This was a waste of money for the trash can (55 dollars) and batteries (12 dollars).The next one I'm going to buy will be a step trash can.
__label__1 not2pleased: I previously owned an automatic trash can and loved it. Unfortunately it was broken in a move. I haved looked everywhere for a new one and decided to try Amazon.com I did find them, and tried to get the same kind but got as close as possible. I was at first very pleased with the product, but within a few days, the rim kept falling inside the can, the batteries kept falling out because the battery cover was not secure. Ended up exchanging the whole can to try it again. I feel this could be a excellent product if the battery compartment were on the back of the lid inside of underneath. Thats the way my previous trash can was made.
__label__1 The battery cover didn't fit: I could no way close the battery cover. So I duck-taped it to hold the baerries. But the batteries were too heavy and they became loose and pushed the cover down into the can. This apparently happened when I emptied the can for the first time. (I ordered this on 1/14/2010.) Sometime after that I realized it stopped working, and found that the cover was permanently lost (to the town dump). I duck-taped the batteries directly into the slot, but after a few hours (maybe a few minutes?) the tape could no longer hold the heavy weight of 4 D-batteries, and became loose. So the trash can is totally useless. Had I bought this from Costco, I would take it to the store and they would refund me. But unfortunately I bought it through amazon.com (I had also threw away the box.) I'll just have to throw this trash can into my trash bin to go to the town trash tump. What a trash product it is. If amazon.com keeps selling products like this it will become a trash company as well.
__label__1 Lid Does not Fit can...: Been using this can for well over a few months now and am now getting around to writing the review. When I first opened this trash can, the lid did not fit the can without an extreme amount of force. Every single time I change the trash bag, I have to literally fight to get the lid back on. Also, this trash can eats batteries like a fat kid eats cake...fast and often.Do not get this trash can!
__label__2 Better than expected.: I purchased this really hoping it wasn't just a gimmick and it wasn't. It works beautifully, keeps the dog out, and was worth every penny.
__label__2 Finally, a trash can that can do tricks: I really like this trash can. It automatically opens when you want it to, then shuts a few seconds later. I've only had a problem if I accidentally turn off the power switch in back. I've replaced the batteries only to discover the switch was turned off. My favorite thing about this trash can, however, is when guests come over! Stand in front of the trash can and pretend it's your pet. Say "Who wants a treat???" and after a few seconds get close enough so your hand trips the infrared and then toss the garbage in. Good boy!
__label__1 over priced touchless trash can: I ordered this product & paid $100 plus for the item. I found the same identical item for $50.00 at Sams club. The plastic gear that controls the lid is way under engineered. It came apart in less than a year. This destroyed the touchless qualityTouch-Free Stainless Steel 13-Gallon Trash Can
__label__1 Nice concept, but poor build quality: I received the trash can with several dents on its side, probably due to shipping. After examining the material it was made of, I concluded that the metal was very thin and flimsy. The dents caused the retainer ring to no longer fit properly in the can. I can say that the lid opening mechanism was very smooth and functional, but the poor build quality of the can itself is why I'm returning it.
__label__1 Too expensive to only work for a year: I'm so sick of these fancy, expensive metal things where the crucial mechanism - in this case the hinge that opens the lid - relies on a tiny piece of flimsy plastic that breaks. This is a beautiful trash can that I liked while it worked, but the little plastic hinge broke and now it's garbage. I've had the same problem with pedal cans - the whole can is stainless steel EXCEPT for the part that should be, and that part inevitably breaks and leaves me with a useless piece of junk. Grrrr.
__label__2 Love the product: I purchased this product two years ago and love it. However, there is one issue with it. As other reviewers stated the mechanism that lets the lid open and close broke off after one year. However, my husband was able to repair it by using super glue. This method worked two more times. Now, that trash can is two years old we can no longer repair it. We are now purchasing our second iTouchless trash can. I hope that they will think about selling the replacement for that mechanism so that when it breaks again we can purchase the part needed instead of the whole product.
__label__1 13 gal touchless: Buyer Beware-The engineering is just terrible. The plastic gear that operates the lid is too small and broke early on, The battery compartment opens to the trash hence when the battery lid fails the lid and the batteries go out with the trash. Touchless sent me a new battery lid(10$ plus 4$ shipping) it smartly went out with the trash as well. After juryrigging the battery compartment with tape it worked for one more day then gave up the ghost and died. I now have a 100$ toy that doesn't work and only did work for a total of 8 weeks.
__label__2 Time Tested: We have had ours for 4 1/2 years. It has served as our kitchen trash can in a busy home. I am back to buy another (my fault I broke it). Mine is in an area where people see it as they walk in. It is sharp-looking and free of bag overhang. My pets are not tempted to pull out trash since it is always contained. It has never malfunctioned. The only precautions I would pass along are that (1) it is easy to mistakenly dispose of the big plastic ring that hold the liner when one is taking out the trash; and (2) the plastic sheet covering the battery-pack fell off once and was carried away to the outside trash. I really hesitated when I purchased it ($$), but it turned out to be well worth it.
__label__2 Great Product: Love this trash can, works exactly as stated. Small enough to fit where I want and large inside. Have had no problems to date.
__label__2 I like it, works for me so far: Before I bought this, I read most of the reviews, positive and negative.most of them are true. So far I am happy with it.
__label__2 great trash can: A great kitchen trash can, opens immediately, sleek design and great capacity. Push the button to the right and the top stays open when you have your hands full of veggie peelings. My husband does not like the ring inside the can which hold the bag in place, he says its too timing consuming to replace the trash bag. Overall, its one of the better trash cans I have ever used in the kitchen.
__label__2 Love it: I really love my new "auto trashcan" I use it for recycling and it is quite busy and works perfectly.
__label__2 Perfect trash can: We purchased this trash can over a year ago. We really like it. Works very well, looks great, fits nicely in a narrow space. We changed the batteries after a year. I would highly recommend this product.
__label__2 Love this group: These guys are professionals and just totally great at what they do. They are truly world-class musicians and can adapt to any sound. If you haven't heard any of their music - it is safe to say that you can pick up and CD of theirs and start listening and enjoying the music.
__label__2 SATISFIED USER: I bought this part to replace a damaged unit on my sons mountain bike. This deraileur is the same make and model as the damaged one. It was delivered as described in the original packaging in quick time.Easy to install and adjust, full instructions included. Works just as it should.
__label__2 Charm City's Up & Coming....: This CD has six good tracks. But the one for the ladies is number 10's "Saying I Love You".
__label__2 If you feel this album then just get it!: Dam! Music I played back in 91 while in 7th grade is like old school rap classics now. I like this albume still today in 2006. Dare I say it but it's a fun album. I mean I know hip-hop now you got to be a "THUG" and all. This album just brings back good memories for me back in a time in 7th and 8th grade early 90s. The beats on this album still play to me and aren't out dated. For example, I brought Ice Cubs' 'The Predator' album just for the 'Check Yo Self' track but all the other song beats on that album are mad out dated. I don't know if your a young cat reading this or someone like me around 29, but this LP is just that good stuff! If you weren't around in 91 you might not be feeling me, but tracks for example; Feminat Fatt, Sobb Story, Show Me a Hero, were just my songs along with many more on this LP. I don't know, I just feel those good beats and the creativty on this album, still today!
__label__2 Don't Need to Be a Plant Expert!: Although I very much enjoy books that simply educate me about certain plants, I am not able to remember all I need to know in a regular, timely fashion. This book, with its month to month format, overcomes that by reminding me to weed-n-feed my lawn, prune my summer flowering shrubs, plant bare root roses, and spray my fruit trees -- all in one chapter entitled, "March"! Also, great reading and pictures! Along with my Southern Living Garden Problem Solver book, I don't need any other gardening books!
__label__1 Poor quality and pretty worthless: The box was a warning: it was cheap and not even square. The bits would not fit into the sockets, so it was nonfunctional. I sent it back for a refund.
__label__2 Good instrument: This has many available choices for watch backs. The watch back must have slots. It is very easy to adjust and removes the back without any problems. In time the cost of this item will save money in taking your watch to a jeweler to have the battery replaced.
__label__2 A little small for a 9-inch pan: I bought this pan for Thanksgiving for making a particular dessert recipe that required a 9-inch square pan. I read the reviews here and knew it might be too small (and it was), but I thought it was so pretty that I could use it for other things if not for the dessert dish. It really is a beautiful pan, but the one I received has a sort of pinkish tinge to the beige. I have other LeCreuset products, and none of them look quite like this.It's still pretty, though, and heats up well for cooking.
__label__2 Buy This One for One of the Best Song Ever Written: Caruso: There are three songs on this CD.If you have seen the PBS Special, you like me were blown away by the powerful performance. She took this beautiful, compelling song that her mother used to sing, and brought it to a new level. Andrea Bocelli's and Pavarotti's version of CARUSO are no where as fulfulling as the Emotionally Packed, Exquisitely Crafted Masterpiece. This song is Reforged TIMELESS. Like she says, when you heard her interpretation of this song, you see, feel, breath, touch the Culture, Soul, History and Essence of ITALY. Not a Breath was wasted. Every nuance, tone, blend of emotions fell into place. I hope when upon listening this song for the very first time, you will be lifted and transported to another place and time. It is truly an unreal experience. Furthermore, Italian is truly a beautiful, expressive language.I bid you Love and Peace.
__label__1 Contains Bad Assumptions and Poor Worldview: I have a few problems with the DVD.1. It assumes that CO2 is causing global warming something that is not scientifically proven. Global temperatures peaked in 1998 and have declined since.2. The DVD says that there is one thing worse than more people is affluence. The DVD believes that more people are bad. It is based on the belief that the earth can only support a certain number of people. People have been producing alarmist documents for 200 years warning of the impending limits on population growth. The earth could very well support 1 trillion people.
__label__2 TV throughout the room: this product allows you to turn a TV to almost any direction in a room. We have it mounted on the wall of our home office to allow viewing from the work area or from the relaxing area. It is well made and works great. if you are hesitant about installing then buy this and hire someone to install. just ensure you mount to studs and follow directions.
__label__2 Navy Seal reader: This book was really good. It focuses on several missions instead of one. The 4 main characters are easy to like and root for. Plenty of action. Looks like it will be a good new series in the Navy Seals area.
__label__1 Action reader: This Seal novel would be better if the writer had a good plot, missions are good but lack realism, team goes in and then out very little action and the spook is just not real. suggest writer add more story and action for both sides. Seals are not perfect all the time, even if they think they are. these missions are to perfect.
__label__1 sounds don't work: i find this product to be lovely. i bought it some months ago for my baby and put it away until now that he is 7 months and we can play with it.but i just found out that the sounds of the bottom 2 rings don't work!! i am so pissed off!!! this is such a pity.
__label__2 Must have for the serious notary.: I was impressed by the breath and depth of this book as well as by the practical examples. I picked up the book used on Amazon but would have gladly paid full price. I keep it in my bag since it serves as a great reference.
__label__2 Reprint of a classic: This is a reprint of a very good book by John White -- likely to take advantage of the 'Prayer of Jabez' craze. While this book might not have the same popular appeal as 'Jabez', I believe it presents a more balanced perspective on prayer through the study of ten unique prayers in the Bible.Even 10+ years later, the observations and lessons from this book still remain true. If you haven't thought much about prayer and God's interaction with us through prayer, this is a great place to start.
__label__1 Broke on first use!: Used smallest pot in set, boiled water, got food out and left the water in pot while it cooled during super. Come back to clean and looked like someone tried to sit on it because the sides were cut at the top and it formed an oval. It still had the water in it, thus it was not someone sitting on it.
__label__2 good item: They worked great for the home canning i did. if i was in the restaurant business would need a heavy grade but for home is ok
__label__2 Shorter Christian Prayer/ the four week Psalter of the Liturgy of the hour: I enjoy this book completely, were I still have my pitfauts with the larger Christian prayer book this little book helps to make things much easier for me to read and understand. Now I'm still learning about how to use this tiny little book.but it is fast becoming one of those books that i reach for each morning and evening at prayer time. thanks it is a great little book to have at hand.
__label__2 Nice Size For A Purse.: This is a nice book for morning and evening prayers. It has a beautiful cover and is the right size to pit into a purse or bag to take on the go. This is a perfect book to start praying the Liturgy Of The Hours.
__label__2 This Fiberglass/Foam Board is a Good, Economical Upgrade from a Wood Board: I've been riding wooden boards for over 2 years now. I saw this board for sale and thought it was way too cheap for a full fiberglass/foam board - but I decided to take a risk and give it a try. It's a major upgrade from my wooden boards. With this, I can waveskim or sandride. It's very light weighing only 5 lbs, has a mild rocker, and comes with a limited lifetime warranty. It's not going to perform as well as $200 - $300 namebrand boards like Victoria, Exile, Zap, etc.; but for the price I paid I'm very happy.
__label__2 Great Service: I received my purchase within 7 days of ordering it and as described. I will be using this vendor again!!!!!
__label__1 when faith is not enough: If you are looking for a universalist's approach to dealing with doubt, then this is the book for you. Clark's arguments completely miss the nature and cause of the majority of doubt that i have encountered (Pastor 25 years). To offer advice to Christians over and above Faith is not only foolish it is dangerous. Clark's arrogant approach may work in the ivory tower, but for the rest of us, dont waste your time or money.
__label__1 Poor content, bad presentation: The movie itself is very run of the mill and humdrum.The video quality is slightly woolly and there are no subtitles or captions on the disc, so very poorly presented from a technical and accessibility standpoint.
__label__2 Makes studying economics easy! Thumbs up!: This book is well organized to help student learn macroeconomics. It has the best utilization of pedagogical features (not just graphs, captions and colors) I've ever seen. I found key term call-outs, section reviews, and keypoint outlines to be the most helpful. I appreciate the efforts of reducing the amount of reading necessary to understand the concepts.If you are not a lazy student, you will have lots of case studies, news analysis, econ puzzles, and biographies to broaden your breath. All these features are well organized so that you can read efficiently, thanks to the ingenious layouts.I am actually here to look for other books by Mr. Taylor to support my current textbooks.
__label__2 Great Alternative for Moms-to-be: This is a great book for parents-to-be who already use and believe in homeopathy. It is a little detailed for beginners. This should be required reading for every OB and Midwife. The case histories are wonderful!
__label__1 A book only the author's mother could love: The people who gave this book a five star rating must be related to the author -- or maybe its the author himself. Honestly, as someone who has read almost every mafia book out there, this book is just so so. People should know that it focuses almost all of its attention on the New Jersey court case and not on the street action. Its more about lawyers and the justice system than it is about criminals and the street.
__label__1 you have to fill it with water: I didn't know that when I bought it, so have not used it yet. It makes it less convenient to use.
__label__1 Don't buy thru Deerso: The item works just fine, howevever, the buying experience thru Deerso was terrible. I paid extra for expedited delivery but after they shipped it they said it would still be seven days from the time I ordered until the time I got it. The customer service people totally didn't care. I will never order anything thru Deerso again!
__label__1 Short Life: I have owned four of these. One for the motorcycle, one for the truck, and one each for the cars.The Good:These gauges are accurate, repeatable, and very small.The Bad:They are disposable. I get maybe a year out of them, which is perhaps 2 uses. I tried to replace the battery in one. It would be somewhat challenging for someone who did not have the necessary micro screw drivers and the patience to remove various items. Inside you will find a shoddy piece of electrical tape holding the battery in place - nice touch. After I installed a new battery, reassembled the gauge, and turned it on, I discovered that it reset itself to units that are unfamiliar to me, perhaps pascals. I never did figure out how to change the units. The price of the product is not worth the time I put into it anyway.I don't recommend this digital pressure gauge.
__label__1 Do not buy - same as other reviews SHORT BATTERY LIFE, TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE DISPOSABLE: Weak...bought for a bike trip and by the time the ride was over, the battery was dead. Very disappointed and waste of $20
__label__2 John has done it Once Again: John's second effort is more than just G.O.O.D. its GREAT! When I first heard Once Again I wasn't sure I would like it, mainly due to my expectations based on Get Lifted. Once Again is not Get Lifted pt.2, it stands firmly on its own two feet, but you will get lifted (pun intended). John blends good old soul music with his own style to create wonderful songs such as "Each Day Gets Better", "Slow Dance" and "Where Did My Baby Go", to name a few. You still get a Get Lifted feel with songs like "Stereo", "Again" and "Another Again". Of course John takes you to his Gospel roots with "Heaven" and "Show Me". This album has something for everyone, if you go in with an open mind you will come out with a musical experience you won't soon forget.
__label__2 Cut from the same cloth as Marvin Gaye: I anxiously awaited this CD after his first CD "Get Lifted" became a smash hit. I actually anticipated somewhat of a sophomore fall off of sorts. You must admit that 1st CD is a tough act to follow. After listening to this CD for a couple of times, I felt it was not quite up to the standard set by his 1st. I mean the 2nd song "heaven" and the 7th "slow dance" are instant classics in my opinion. But it wasn't until I heard the CD several times, the 4th song "show me" and 6th "p.d.a." started to really stand out. I believe as an artist he is as close as you get to the likes of Marvin Gaye. I just happened to hear "Mercy Mercy Me" by Marvin after listening to Legend. I found the likeness, striking. I'm not trying to say he is as great, yet, but he has the potential.
__label__1 Disappointed: Based on a Newsweek recommendation, I'm a first time Legend buyer. After listening once, I tried to listen again and found myself at Half Priced Books where my $10 investment became .75 cents. At least the McDonald's coffee was good. The songs were smooth. Smooth as in flat, without interest or color. Were the words introspective and deeply meaningful? I don't know, my attention kept wandering.If jazzy, soulful, romantic ballads are for you grab this one. Its just not for me.
__label__1 Copy-Cat: The song "Save Room" is almost exactly like the Classics IV "Stormy." Listen to both and you'll see. I thought John Legend was supposed to be good. Turned me off really bad.
__label__2 excellent product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! best price!!!!!!!!!!!: I purchased this product for my 55inch Phillips flat screen tv for my room.i just move into in a townhouse and just purchased my tv and needed wall mount. it came in like 2 days, i will say when i first received it and saw how small and light the box was i thought i got ripped off.I made my brother(who thought i should hire a professional to install it) install it for me. it took him about 2 hours to do it, but it turned out great. its now December(purchased in October) i have no issues at all with it. now my brother did go to best buy and purchased a wall mount for $60 something dollar and he now regret that he spent that much money on a wall mount, but men they just don't listen lol.I can honestly say its a great purchased, if your not picky and just need a wall mount that works and is sturdy, then this is it. If i had let the negative reviews get to me then i would have regret it.love!!!! love !!!!
__label__2 Great Value: This is a good mount for the money. I used a professional to install mine and he commented that the mount was very good. It's comparable to others that are much more expensive.
__label__2 47" is hanging on it: My 47' is hanging on it, and it works great! Easy to install and easy to mount the hdtv. I have a Vizio. Dont know if that matters much but it works great!
__label__2 Good quanity at good price: Brought this for $29.99 after much research and I'm very happy with the result!I put up my 42'' Vizio LED TV with no problem.Pros:I like how hey give you different sizes of screws and universal washersMaterial: very sturdy, solid build.Installation: Much easier than I thought. The hardest part was finding the stud in the wall.Con:Only complain I have its the design of the TV mount leaves little space behind the TV. Not a big problem, just make sure to plug in your power cord and other cable before mounting the TV to the wall.
__label__2 Great wall mount: It was cheap and it works perfectly. I mounted it twice since I moved 3 months ago. IT tilts down so I can watch TV from my Bed and can be adjusted for perfect position. It does not tilt sideways and does not stick out. I prefer that it does not stick out because I prefer to have it stick to the wall as much as possible. The only thing that is bad about that is it can be hard inserting cables to the TV sometimes.
__label__2 For the price you can't go wrong...: I used this to wall-mount my 46" LED TV in my living room. My parents couldn't believe I got a wall-mount for so cheap when they spent about 4 times as much on theirs! For the price, you can't go wrong. It's not the best mount, but it'll do the trick on a budget. I previously bought a more expensive mount from a store which is what holds my 42" LCD TV in the bedroom, and I will say that mount is better. The tilt feature on that is better, and unlatching it to take it off the wall (if needed) is easier than it is with this one. Tightening the screws at the bottom of this mount at the end of the installation process was kind of a pain.
__label__2 Happy: Installed for a 42" samsung tv. Saved a ton of money not buying one in a store! So happy with this product. Im ordering a second one for our bedroom tv.
__label__2 Good TV Mount: I mounted a 55" LCD TV to my brick fireplace with this item. No issues with the product itself although the instructions were absolutely pathetic. Shipping was very fast and package was in perfect condition. The free cable is o.k. for standard definition but certainly not for use with Hi-def!I would buy this product again.
__label__2 Great Economical Wall Mount: what a great deal on a wall mount! Why in the world anyone would pay double and triple the price of this wall mount is beyond me. The installation was simple and easy.......just follow the instructions that are enclosed with the mount. We mounted a 42" Zenith plasma tv and did not have any problems.
__label__2 TV wall hanger: This bracket is sturdy. I liked the way the TV just hangs up before you tighten all the screws in the lower bracket clips. It takes a lot to lift the 52" TV the six feet to the mount but if you can do that then you feel confident that it will not fall down. It took three men to lift the TV above the fireplace. It clipped right in and the rest was easy. I liked the way the TV can slide on the bracket from side to side and tilt to where you like it best.
__label__2 Very pleased: I have a 50 inch Panasonic and the mount worked perfectly. Easy to install and they provide screws for all surfaces you would mount to. You need to be able to find the studs in your wall, and once the TV is mounted plugging in new plugs is hard. It is best to plug things in before you put it on the wall. Mount works great though would recommend
__label__2 Perfect for my TV: I recently purchased a 60" Plasma TV. I found this wall mount on Amazon. It worked perfectly. I can't understand why someone would pay hundreds of dollars for the SAME thing you can get online for a fraction of the cost. The quality of the mount is great and the mounting is extremely easy. Don't waste your money paying someone to mount your flat screen TV. Do it yourself and save a ton of money. I would highly recommend this product.
__label__2 Holding a 65" plasma well: I bought this to mount our TV and it is working well. The only improvement I'd like to see is for screw holes closer to the middle, so that you can bolt through 3 sets of studs (left, center, and right) when mounting this to the wall...I added the holes to secure to the center stud myself. The level included with the kit...wasn't - but I don't count that as a big negative, as I would expect to have a good quality level myself for a job like this.
__label__1 embarrassing: Daniels' poetry is just prose, and his prose is, well, just slop. This book is just plain awful.
__label__2 Unique Approach to Bargello: I will not critique this book. I do not yet know if the directions can be followed or the advice given is useful. I have only just received my copy of this interesting book. I will tell you one thing, it is unique. The designs, the idea and the approach are original. I also can't fault her color use.I am writing a lot of these reviews. As a buyer of these out-of-print books, I always wish there was more information about them out there. So, here I am. I am currently (ok, for almost a year now) working on a needlepoint project that has a saying *THE CHEESE STANDS ALONE*
__label__2 Colin Hay and the Genius of Herbie Hancock: Looking for Jack is a good record, and Colin Hay is such a talent. The title track is the gem here, in part because Herbie Hancock laid down perhaps the most brilliant piano track ever recorded on a pop song that few have ever heard. It compliments the song, the arrangement and Colin's voice so well, yet at the same time it's a song in itself. It flourishes with such a melodic playfulness, it makes the whole track irresistible.
__label__2 Work great!: Bought these for my 2005 subaru wrx jdm fog lights. they work great! They put out plenty of yellow light, which is much better suited for foggy conditions.
__label__2 exellent epic escapist science fiction: I can definitely count Kage Baker as one of my favorite authors (as well as Daniel Keys Moran and Dan Simmons). I have enjoyed all of the company novels and this was no exception. The storyline is quite complex and has some of the most well developed and intricate characters that I have ever read; they also possess a quality that most characters in novels recently have lacked: you actually care what happens to them and how they evolve! So to the person who said "Baker may be losing his grip on the plot" well ... first of all if you have truly READ the books you would know that Kage Baker is a LADY and second, the story is only expanding and becoming truly intricate. Thank you and good night!
__label__2 "Kids, Lets Put On A Show.": Love the movie and love the soundtrack! Although the soundtrack is exceptional, it is not without it's share of problems. The soundtrack is jam packed with glam classics from Brian Eno, T Rex, Roxy Music, PULP, Lou Reed, Venus in Furs etc. Granted that the album is full of priceless glam classics it is not the COMPLETE SOUNDTRACK. I noticed that there are songs that are missing, for example there are two Brian Eno songs featured in the movie that where not in the soundtrack, amoungst others. Speaking of missing songs, it wouldn't have botherd me a bit if they left out the songs coverd by Ewam Mcgregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. I can't believe they where allowed to tarnished an Eno number, and T.V Eye! Their vocals are pathetic! But what redeems the album is the PULP song, and the other glam classics. Not perfect, but a great soundtrack.
__label__1 Very uneven: I got this cd becasue one i am a fan of glam rock, it was a good price and i am a fan or radioehead. How can you have soundtrack that is about the glam rock scene of the 70s and not include bowie. All of the covers are not nearly as good as the originals. The only good songs are Virgina Plain and Satelite of Love and Camel in the eye but those are the original songs and i have those songs allready. The songs of Venus and Furs dispointed me it seem Thom was trying to sound like Bryan Ferry on them it would have been better if he just used his own voice. If you want a good glam rock soundtrack may i suggest Hedwig and The Angry inch most of the songs are sung by one singer who has a better voice then most of the rock singers out today. That soundtrack acutally does not sound like a soundtrack which i think is best i am not a big fan of various artist cds. I ended up selling it for more then i paid for it.
__label__2 an accurate model of glam times: I really wasn't crazy about the movie. But the Cd is really great. Shudder To think is the Danny Elfman of the late 90's.Highlight tracks: TV Eye, a great cover of 20th century Boy, Satelite of Love and Baby's on Fire is soo cool! I wonder if Bowie likes this CD?-Jules Cohen (lead singer of Spiritease)Brand New album available! "multigenerational alter pop/rock"
__label__2 Amazing: I had never hear of this movie or the soundtrack until I saw Jonathan Rhys Meyers in Gormenghast and had to watch all his movies. I at first found the movie strange, but it grows on you and the music is amazing. My favorites have to be Ballad of Maxwell Demon and The Whole Shebang. Even if you didn't like the movie you have to love the music, especially if you love David Bowie music like I do.
__label__2 Must have gotten a bad batch: I'm only getting about 3 of 4 good copies from this set. I've used these before with only 2 or 3 bad disks in the set....not this time though.
__label__2 Product performed as expected: I have gone through about 300 disk recordings and none have failed. The fact that I have not had a disk to fail saves me time and money.
__label__1 Doesn't work well in DVD player: I've had this problem before, but forgot and bought Memorex again. Recorded movies seem to work well in a computer, but on my DVD player they are unreadable. Probably about 1/4 of them were bad. You may suspect I have a bad DVD player, but I haven't had any problems with other brands. There is always the possibility my DVD player is getting weak, but there's no denying that so far I've only had problems with Memorex.
__label__1 Cuisinart ICE-21 Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker--broke third time used: I see that the Model 20 is no longer advertised. My experience with it is:Used it 3 times. Worked fine.Fourth time----- VERY noisy. But that isn't my problem with it. After the ice cream was made (looked fine) I (and a strong man) could not 'unlatch' the top! And we tried everything except a hammer.I would love to know if anyone else had that problem.
__label__1 Only worked for a short time!: I bought this new, and it worked great, UNTIL I made the mistake of taking the freezing bowl out of the freezer, to thaw out, and stored it for 1 week. When I refroze it a week later, it never made ice cream again, no matter how cold the freezer was or how long I kept it in there. I suspect that once you freeze it and keep it in the freezer, you MUST keep it in there from then on and NEVER thaw it out. I returned mine, but I will never buy this type of ice cream maker again for fear that it won't work.
__label__2 Yukon Game Gambrel: I purchased a Yukon Game Gamble about 2 months ago prior to the Kentucky upcoming deer season. During my hunt, I killed a large 10 point buck with a bow and used the Yukon Game Gamble to hang the animal from a rafter in a barn in order to field dress and process the animal. This item was so easy to use and will allow one person to manage hanging an animal that weighed around 160 - 180 lbs with little to no effort. The instructions were very clear and the item works flawlessly. This is definitely an item every hunter needs. I will recommend this to all my hunting buddies and friends. Thanks Yukon.... Rick
__label__2 Whaling: Whaling has a long and exciting history. There are chapters in this book on the Dutch and English whalers, the famous Yankee whalers, the Norwegian and Japanese whalers, and a special chapter on the whales themselves.
__label__1 Mis-represented: The "Title" of this item indicates it comes with 2 K Type thermocouple probes. In the manufacturers description it infers the probes range is to 1832 F. "The truth is it comes with 1 type K probe only usable to 482 F". The other mis-representation is that it comes with a protective Holster. The truth is it comes with an orange protective rubber over cover.I would like to see these inaccuracies corrected on the Amazon web site but cannot see a way to contact them.
__label__2 Flows beautifully--like an open wound: By the time I'd gotten to "Slayer of Gods," I'd gobbled up the previous five in order, thereby attaining the level of anticipation of a hammerhead shark in a sea of Egyptian blood. I must say it was sheer pleasure to chomp through this one. Ms. Robinson is in the best narrative form of the whole series. There are no serious breaks in the flow and action and the whole meal was over in wink, leaving me still quite bloodthirsty for more. Don't peek at any plot details! The previews reveal too much. I have to say that I figured this one out almost immediately, and I think you will too. But it's wonderfully done from a dramatic and character perspective. I give it only four stars because, to me, the plot has a many holes. Enough to make me uncomfortable, and I'm not the fussy type. Nevertheless, a scrumptious --and very suspenseful-- gobble.
__label__2 Small but good: At 8 1/2" it is quite small but it's perfect if you're just making eggs for yourself or something like that. Quick clean up and heats up fast as well.
__label__1 There is only one word to describe this book: tedious.: I made the mistake of buying several of the books in this series because the main character sounded interesting: an overweight, middle-aged PI, (i.e not your run of the mill detective). Unfortunately, the books turned out to be uniformly tedious! The entire book consists of an endless succession of "witness interviews" interspersed with minute descriptions of every meal this "full bodied" woman eats. (And she eats constantly!) When the main character tries to act "cute," making what is intended to be humorous observations, she only comes off as irritating. I would definitely NOT recommend this series, unless you suffer from insomnia.
__label__2 Great Book: Loved this book. It is written so well that is makes you feel you are literally there at times experiencing exactly what Caro's is describing. So very much worth getting and reading. And do not forget the other two books on LBJ that Caro wrote: Means of Ascent and Master of the Senate. The three are a trilogy with the Path to Power being the first one you should read. Well worth your time and money!!
__label__2 Outstanding. Highly Readable and Insightful. A Must Read!: This is a cherished book in our household, enjoyed equally by our history buffs and our novices. It is fascinating reading, and we cannot wait until the third volume is published!
__label__1 A historian's analysis: Succinctly, the book is trash. It is another product of the Republican sleaze machine. Some good trees were ruined for nothing.
__label__2 Beethoven DVD Audio: Shipment prompt. Item as described. This DVD Audio will not become one of my favorites.
__label__1 a dissapointment compared to his last one .: what is this? Meth was so raw and hard-core on his first album and then this.i was really disapointed when i heard this.This was the one rapper i expeected to keep it real. and what the hell is with the cyborg gear?
__label__1 Slightly Enlightening: I was disappointed in the lack of content in this book. While I was slightly enlightened with what appear to be some interesting facts, I believe there could have been much more information, resulting in a much thicker book. I finished this in two quick sittings (about a 3.5 hour read). This was a rush job, without a lot of commitment to research. The last few artists barely get a mention. Randy Rhodes, the guitarist that resurrected Ozzy Ozborne's career gets 1.5 pages??
__label__1 Miles, distorted in mono...again: This is a very simple, but straight forward review. All tracks are in MONO. However, that's not the main problem with this CD. Tracks 3 (Teo) and 4 (Walkin') are very distorted during Mile's heavy solos. This is truly a historic recording, but don't waste your money. I paid $0.98 cents for it used and that was too much. I don't want to waste anymore of your time reviewing this CD...just don't buy it, take it from an avid Miles Davis collector.
__label__1 Simply Awfull: This is a terrible re-make of the original movie, which was quite good. What a waste of talent, stay away from this mish-mash of a movie.
__label__1 Oh, the horror!: Quite a tedious movie I must say. For fans of horror this film fails to show anything truly scary. Chris Kattan displayed some terrific acting though. But the whole idea was it to be scary and it failed to do that for me.
__label__1 DVD would not play through: I really liked this movie. I've been looking for it for a while. I Recieved the movie in the mail yesterday, I watched 1/2 of it before it started skipping. I've seen it a thousand times, but I would have liked to have what I paid for.
__label__2 Scarier than the Exorcist!: I have been a horror film fan for years and I haven't came across a horror movie that has scaried me as bad as the Exorcist. This movie has out done the Exorcist and it will send chills down your spin.
__label__1 Why did I bother?: I kind of wanted to see this movie when it originally came out in theaters, but I never got around to it...I'm glad I didn't. This movie was really bad. Most of the scenes just didn't make any sense. The characters weren't likeable at all, I couldn't have cared less if they all got killed. The acting was awful and the script was just down right horrendous. Some of the worst lines came from chris kattan's character like, "this house is alive, we're all gonna die" and "you give me my money right now...I want it, so you give it". Thats the kind of bad script that I'm talking about. The only slightly decent thing in this movie is some of the special effects. I would also like to give credit to geoffery rush for trying to do the best he could with what he was given. All and all...don't watch this movie.
__label__1 Very Disturbing: This movie has some very disturbing images in it. The plot started out well, but then just turned sick, the ending is like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, it never would have happened anywhere else, but Hollywood. A horrible movie.
__label__1 Talk About A Dive Of A Movie: Probably, the worst movie I ever saw. Not only did the plot diminish as the movie progressed, but the acting was ridiculous. This was a poor attempt on the writers to make a scary movie out of a nothing plot and it wasn't even that scary. More or less, it was stupid and the idea was very unclear. After watching it, I couldn't tell you what it was about. Well, Actually, it was about a house on haunted hill, but who didn't know that already. 5 people visit it and I bet you can quess what happens from here. They die, amazing. Yeah right. What ever happens to you don't and I mean don't, see this disgrace of a movie.
__label__1 Awful: Sure, the original Vincent Price film was cheesy, but it's a classic. This film is neither cheesy or a classic, it's just plain BAD. I don't understand what the draw to this type of "horror" is; it's simply not scarry.Poorly made, bad acting, bad everything... don't waste your time.
__label__2 Definitely worth a look...at Jeffrey Combs: Jeffrey Combs is underused here (like he is in seemingly every movie that he is in), but Director William Malone utilizes a great score to keeps things moving at a crisp pace, to hide the warts in the plot (like why anyone in their right mind would go downstairs). This is a vast improvement over the stinkeroo of an original. Not real scary, but if they had used more of Jeffrey Combs as the mad doctor, they really could have had something special.Bonus points for the DVD extras, which are excellent. Why would anyone use VHS at this day and age? Go DVD and see this movie in all of its glory.
__label__1 not even woth renting: is this movie......what is the word? sure it is bloody and gross but there is no story line and it is boring thru out. what was the point? They tried to make it interesting with all the bloody scenes and the killings but it turned out to be stupid and really unwatchable. What was supposed to be a scary good movie turned out a bad, silly, movie.
__label__2 DELIGHTFUL: This is a really easy to read book. Very matter of fact and as it's written by Michael Jackson himself it is a real joy. It's a very nice looking book as well and I particularly like the way his signature is on one of the front pages so you feel as though he has actually signed it for the reader. It's delightful. It is interesting how the reader has the opportunity to 'hear' Michael Jackson's version and intepretation of various events, which is markedly different from the tabloid press and various writers. If you have already read books about Michael Jackson, you will recognise some of the events mentioned in the book. The reader gets an insight into Michael Jackson's interpretation of the world rather than the tabloids' interpretation of Michael Jackson's world.
__label__2 A Must Read For Any MJ Fan: This is Michael in his own words. I couldn't put it down. If you are looking to get a sense of what Michael was like and how he truly was , then read this book. I recommend this book to any MJ fan and also " The Magic and the Madness " By J. Randy Taborelli . Michael went through so much when he was alive. It almost sadness me to read all that he had dealt with. He was such a good person. A caring person, a true humantarian. But most people forger that and want to focus only on the negative and what the media says. Michael was one of the greatest entertainers of music history and there will never be another like him.
__label__2 Beautiful book by a beautiful man!: This book is incredible! If you really want to know Michael Jackson..this will tell you what you need to know.
__label__2 Touching and humerous yet helpful for those seeking answers: I have just finished reading this theraputic and helpful book For Those Who Love Time is Eternal. It relates to common everyday problems that happen within relationships and has witty, thought-provoking and helpful meditations to soothe the soul. It doesn't give answers but it helps you find answers within yourself. It has daily meditations for: jealousy, simple interest,body language, and not having the ability to read minds. I really enjoied this book and recommend it for everyone-Krystal Clairson
__label__2 Complete list: This may be in the incorrect order, but these are all the episodes.1.Have You Seen This Snail?2.Rock Bottom3.The Great Snail Race4.Reef Blower5.Good Neighbors6.Krabs vs Plankton7.Lost Matress8.Skill Crane
__label__2 yay by hilfan90210 from l.i.n.y.: i luv sb! the episodes are:have you seen this snail?good neighbors (whatz wit da phezez?)the great snail race (how did tentacles turn into torlini?)skill crane (y kant i win 1?)the lost mattress (y prime cutz?)&krabz vs. plankton (can some1 tell me wat happend)what happend 2 dat doctor guy shown in seasons 1-3? he wasnt in funny pants & now i think bout him & itz DRIVING ME INSANE!!!!!
__label__2 Great looking watch: Couldn't be more pleased with the look and performance of this watch. The only drawback is that the date is a little difficult to set. Other than that, excellent purchase.
__label__2 I love it, love it, love it!!!: Best watch out there for a female. It is elegant, cute and goes with everything! I got this watch as a Valentines Day gift 3 years ago...I absolutely love it! No mechanical problems at all. I hope Seiko makes the same watch but with their new Kinetic technology. This is definitely worth the buy from Amazon because local dealers charge the full price. You wont be disappointed with this purchase. The picture does not do it justice.
__label__1 So Bad It's Funny!: Billonaire Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) arranges a party at the abandoned Vannacutt Psychiatrist Institute for the Criminally Insane (in short, House on Haunted Hill). The Institute was once the site of the most horrifying medical experiences in history. Price announces that anyone who manages to spend an entire night in the house will win $1,000,000! He has secretly rigged the house with insidious devices designed to scare the guests out of staying, but his tricks soon become meaningless, as thr mansion begins to generate terror on its own. Before their night of terror is over, the desperate inhabitants will unlock the secrets of the house or suffer the wrath of the demonic evil that haunts the walls of the former insane asylum.House on Haunted Hill is a forgettable movie with laughable performances and a flippin' terrible script. It is equally terrible with The Haunting, 1999's other so-bad-it's-funny try-hard 1999 horror.
__label__1 Poorly written, poorly edited: Although I did learn a lot about Millard Filmore from this book, I think the presentation was flawed. It contains many errors, repetitions, and examples of bad editing. The author is one of those few people (mostly from the south) who insist that the Civil War wasn't about slavery and he brings this up several times. This detracts from his credibility. Though it was written quite recently, it reads as if it was written in the late 19th or early 20th century.
__label__2 Pure Ear Candy: I too bought the tape when it first came out and WORE IT OUT. I just paid a lot for the CD (used) and it was worth every bit of it. How exciting to be listening to this album again. Love it.
__label__1 Horrible!!!: This is the worst hair removing system ever!! It pinches your skin horribly and does not remove the hairs. You have to continue going over and over the same hairs and for sensitive areas ( armpits, bikini) it is far too painful to even use. Save your money.
__label__2 Epilady Lengend Purchase: I purchased the Epilady Legend on Amazon.com for a Christmas present. I had already used this product and was very happy with it so I decided to purchase it for my daughter. It is a great item. The service I received from Amazon was also great, the item shipped in time for me to give it as a Christmas gift.Thanks Amazon.Rita
__label__2 Better than waxing any day.: I used to have an older style epilady and loved it but this new model is even better. It has lots of little tweezers that rotate and pull your hairs out. It takes a minute to get used to using it before your skin becomes desensitized but it's not that bad. The results leave you with smooth skin,no nubs and no more shaving for 3-4 weeks.
__label__2 Good product: I have used Epilady for about 10 years. This one was bought as a gift for my 14 year old granddaughter. I am hoping to spare her many years of distress.
__label__2 Cordless Epilady - great product: I was using the old coil type Epilady that I had purchased years ago on my underarms. It worked okay, but it had a cord that developed a short after many years of use so I needed to replace it. I purchased the cordless Epilady and I love it. I have used it at least a half dozen times and it still doesn't need to be recharged. It does a good job and it is reasonably painless. It is very compact.
__label__1 Domenick's Opinion: Boring. Slow. Predictable. Saving graces? Great Italian scenery, which you might as well concentrate on as the movie doesn't deseve that much attention. Even with his subtefuge I still don;t see why they woiuld becomne freinds with Matt Damon's charchter considering he came across as a stupid twit. Mr. Damon is a good actor so it must have been the directors perception of the role. Overall a waste of time.
__label__2 it's ok.....: My 2.5 yr old loves thomas, he has great hand eye coordination, so i thought we would try this game, even if his 4.5 yr old sister had to help. Ok so the game graphics are definately rough, and so are the voices. Both kids were very frustrated along with me on the lack of control in turning thomas down different tracks. as you are "driving" thomas a small screen in the corner shows a map with blinking lights of where you need to go next (along with an arrow) but getting thomas to turn is not easy. other than that it cute, and a pretty easy concept for the game. and well it's thomas!! so my son is happy.
__label__1 Weak: Young, inexperienced no-names are invited to get beat up on by the Gracie's best. I felt bad for these guys. Gracies are shameless.
__label__2 A good documentary on early years of MMA: A good look at the life inside and outside of the ring of an mixed-martial-art contestant, Rickson Gracie. His family helped popularize the concept of MMA competition for North American audiences with the debut of the Ultimate Fighting Champsionship back in 1993 in Denver, Colorado. Even though Rickson is probably the strongest Gracie in terms of physical and technical abilities, the family chose Royce to compete in UFC to demonstrate that a physically small person can defeat much larger opponents using superior grappling techniques.If you're a fan of MMA, this is a good DVD to watch to see how competition has evolved over the years.
__label__2 Rickson Gracie, just one reason to buy this movie: This movie is exactly what the american public needs to see!They don't respect our sport, its sometimes dubbed as being "so brutal its nauseating".The movie shows it not just dumb weight lifters who jump in a cage and beat the hell out of each other.Men who have trained most of their lives, dedicated to their disipline need somewhere to show their skill. They turn to the world of NHB combat.This movie depicts the best fighters(although i share the same feelings with others reviwers about Todd Hayes and Koichiro Kimura not being as great as they are showed to be)talking about training, their feelings about fighting, their art, even dying in the ring.If your a fan of NHB combat or Rickson Gracie this video is a must see!
__label__1 onclear: why is this book not updated??? drug companies are constantly changing prescription drugs...so what is correct today might be wrong a year from now..this book should be pulled off the shelves!!
__label__2 puzzled about editor: why is the editor of this book listed as Andrew j. Buda in the search and Brenda Adderly in the link?
__label__2 Great Basic Coffee Maker: This is a great coffee maker if you're looking for something easy to use and programmable. Also for the price it is a great deal.
__label__2 Great coffeemaker for the price!: Just purchased my third and fourth Michael Graves' Coffeemakers. My husband and I go through a lot of coffee--from making up his thermos in the morning--to keeping the pots going up until the time we go to bed. We wore out the first two--the heating plates do tend to give out--but that's my only criticism. The coffee tastes great, I love the styling and the no drip pour spout of the decanters.In my opinion, for the price, it's the best value out there.
__label__1 Overflows and makes a mess: I bought this coffee maker specifically for the removable water reservoir. However, I'd much prefer the mess made by a non-removable reservoir to having coffee and grounds all over the counter. If the basket doesn't seat JUST and the carafe isn't pushed to the front right of the warming plate the pause-and-brew will engage and the whole thing overflows. This seems to be happening about once a week, despite our efforts to line everything up just so. I would not walk but run from this model.
__label__1 I wanna love this machine: I like the way it looks and love that I can remove and replace the water reservoir thing,but it is very finicky, to the point that I was just thinking about replacing it after only a couple weeks.It's fine when it works but every thing about it has to be just so or the coffee won't drip. & the way it is designed, it is unclear that there is a problem until it's not making coffee. I've been using drip machines for over 20 years and never had this kind of issue before. I think it's the machine.
__label__1 Lasted 8 months: I purchased this coffee maker last July and it's now not working.Used Daily. Worked well initially. Anyone else have issues with short product life?
__label__1 Needlessly hard and difficult to use: I consider this book a major disappointment. Much of the material is well-presented, but too many words are used in the exercises (and in the dialogues of each lesson) that do not turn up in the glossary in the back. I find the book really heavy going even with a dictionary. Some of the grammatical explanations are good, but there are many idiomatic usages in the lessons and no real guidance of how to use them. Even after working through the book and tapes I don't feel at all confident in even simple conversation. Coverage of phonics is very skimply and the differences between different phonemes are not explained. The recorded dialogues on the tapes are spoken very fast and are extremely difficult to follow. I feel that the author could have used much more input from would-be users- a book that purports to be a "teach yourself book" should be much more self-contained. It should not be necessary so often for the user of it to have to consult outside references.
__label__1 A decent...albeit real basic book: As a beginners book it wasn't bad, but I was expecting something new or more advanced that I've read in better books previously.AdvancedMacking.Com and How to be the jerk that women loveare much better books than this one.
__label__2 A morally chilling novel of suspense.: Vachss shows he has literary guts in this Burke novel,where our anti-hero is hunting down a cult that preys onchildren and trains them for murder. Burke will have toconfront his deepest demons, and question the morals ofhis vigilantism in this excellent novel.
__label__2 The Cerebral Detective: This series ages well, perhaps because of the 1930s setting, and it is a change of pace from the slam bang action of American detective shows. It creates more mental stimulation than emotional, without the soporific effect of many Brit detective shows.
__label__2 poirot: Watch it daily and Love it. A bit more stimulating in regard to the investigations involved and intriguing in the manner portrayed.
__label__1 Cheaply Made: I can see why this rack is so inexpensive. It's very cheaply made, with splinters of wood hanging off of it. The parts are connected with staples, too! Very shoddy workmanship. I really only wanted the utensil drainer, so I'm happy with that. My old rack is much better quality, so I'll keep it and toss this piece of garbage. It's not worth spending money to send it back.
__label__1 Way Too Complicated: I usually cook everything from scratch and don't mind spending a few hours making several appetizers. BUT, to make just one recipe in this book, you'd need to spend a couple of hours. The majority of the recipes are too fussy and complicated and just not worth the trouble. I made a couple of the crepe appetizers with different fillings. They were the least time-consuming but the result still wasn't worth the effort - no one took seconds.
__label__2 Comprehensive look at formal hors d'oeuvres: This is an incredibly beautiful book. Not only will you enjoy looking at the fabulous pictures, but you will also be inspired as you browse through it planning a party. Be forewarned, however, that almost all of the recipes in this book are geared towards very formal settings. If you're looking for quick, satisfying and tasty appetizers to whip out when friends stop by, this is not the book to turn to. Nevertheless, it is very thorough in discussing the various kinds of hors d'oeuvres and the elements of each. This makes it great for home cooks looking for a little education, and if you ever give a formal party, this would be the perfect book to use.
__label__1 Replacement transducer: This transducer performs well for fishfinding but was advertised as having a temperature sensor. It doesn't work! It would cost too much to uninstall and return so I just kept it. My trolling motor does have a temp sensor when hooked to the same finder. Temperature is most important to me when bass fishing so I am not too worried, disappointed but not worried.
__label__2 Affordable and what I needed: Had a good price and I was able to determine exactly what I needed. It was shipped on time and matched up like I had hoped
__label__2 A lot less intimidating than he looks: Despite the goth-punk getup Jean Beauvoir sports in the cover photo, fans of noisy, hard-driving rock are not going to find it here. Instead, Beauvoir, whose voice recalls that of Mic Murphy of techno-funk duo The System, lays down a good solid set of sunny, upbeat power-pop and a couple of well-crafted, nicely polished pop ballads. Though not well known for his own recordings, JB has had a long tenure in the music industry, and he has worked with a prolific and diverse mix of artists including legendary hard rockers Kiss and doo-wop vocal group The Flamingos (whom he sang with for a short time).
__label__2 Powerful and refreshing angle on Holiday favorites. Get it!: Gather powerhouse musicians, an orchestra, choir, and writer Rob Mathes, and what do you get? You get an incredible seasonal masterpiece of songs only available, until now, to select audiences. Rob Mathes has made a name for himself in the New York area as a powerful singer/song writer, who really knows how to put on a show. With his guest musicians Vanessa Williams, Michael McDonald, and David Sanborn, he has created a live CD that every household should have throughout the holidays! Keep it coming!
__label__2 Simply the Best!: Stumbled upon the PBS airing of this Christmas Special in 98' and fell in love! What a musician![...] This is our favorite Christmas cd and we too have been known to listen to it all year. Just sit back, relax and oh yeah, don't forget to turn up the VOLUME!
__label__2 How quick do you want it?: Product was recieved very quick. Just one order, click and it is on the way. Great way to do business!Wish everything in life could go so smoothly.
__label__2 Sad story of one of show biz's most dysfunctional families: If you want to know what could possibly lead Michael Jackson to think there is nothing inappropriate about sleeping with young boys in his bed, read this book! As much as I admire Michael's top-notch performances and his discipline as an entertainer and businessman, I am saddened by his poor judgement as a parent, his inability to deal with his sexuality in appropriate ways, his inordinate plastic surgery, and his general fear of the adult world with the responsibilities it entails. I can agree wholeheartedly that his childhood is worse than that of Christina Crawford's 'Mommie Dearest', and that his father will have so much to account for on judgement day for the nightmare he put all of his children through. But what's really sad is that this man has more than enough money to invest in some serious counseling, and he WON'T get it. Tarborelli should publish an updated version of this book immediately.
__label__1 Fun Projects for You and the Kids: David Stiles: The book is extremely vague. I thought the book would contain plans to construct forts, playhouses, etc. This is not the case. The book has drawings with a few overall dimensions, but lacks specifics. It does not contain plans, materials lists, etc. This is not a "how to" book.
__label__1 Sucked: Couldn't get it to work. It had nothing to do with my PC. Runnning an Alienware PC couldn't figure it out but didn't bother to figure it out. It was a cheap game.
__label__1 Lousy Support: this game does not load on the most common video cards. I am a Microsoft Partner, etc. and can't even get the game to load and run properly. Over a dozen documented contacts to tech support never get replies. To date, it has been 3 months and I have given up on the product and support.
__label__1 i cant play this game: i bought this game and now i have no way to play it because my grapgics card isnt good enough and amazon makes it imposable to make a return because they hired an idiot to design thier site, anyone who wet to a computer career school know that a contact number and email should be visamle and easy to find from the home page... i cant find a number or email at all
__label__1 Poor Chrome Plating: This product does what it is intended to do, however the chrome plating on the tool was done poorly. Now the plating is flaking off in little tiny pieces that look like little metal shavings all over my garage floor. Overall this tool is low quality and a poor addition to my collection. I would not recommend this product.
__label__2 If you haven't seen it, you are missing out!!!: If there is one television show you can make time for this is the one. You will not be disappointed!! You will want to thank me.
__label__1 Its Jerry Springer in a hospitol.: In this show, every doctor sleeps with one another, every doctor has had surgery on themselves in the hospital, Gray and Mc dreamy have done nothing but break up and get back together, every man is a complete pussy, doctors holler at there patients, there is no punishment for murdering patients, and everyone cheats on there spouses. Yeah this show is complete crap.
__label__2 Grey's Anatomy: This is one of my must see shows. I enjoyed viewing the season in its entirety. They advertised 19 unaired scenes, and I don't think that there were quite that many, so I was a little disappointed with that part.
__label__2 Awesome: Loved watching the beginnings of one of the greatest shows on TV! Can't wait for the 2nd season to make it to DVD in Sept.!
__label__2 Good stuff: I am a physician so a lot of the medical matter makes me wince and I bear it. Yet, there are those moments in every episode when I see the actors address real human emotions and frustrations. That is when I almost forget that I am looking at more of the same sorta St.Elsewhere/ER "let's play doctor" trash. This isn't trash....it is entertainment.The cast is almost believable !
__label__2 Great viewing.: I only discovered Grey's Anatomy part way through the second season, so this was essential viewing for me! What a fantastic cast! Totally enjoyed it, and have now ordered Season 2.
__label__1 If it worked, It might be nice: I had CC:Bridge Too Far, and loved it. I bought this with hopes of more maps, and more weapons. My issue is I have a new Intel4 PC, and it runs everything else fine, but CC:IN takes about 2 seconds (sometimes more) before my <Click> has a reaction (ie. selection, conformation, placement, etc). With such simple graphics, and game-play, it should be Instant.If anyone knows how to fix this I will update my review, but at this point the game is unplayable.
__label__1 buyer beware: If you have the most recent version of WordPerfect, beware, this product will not install the WP8 language module on a Windows 98 platform. Apparently NT and 95 will do, but not 98. They couldn't mention this in the advertising? Duh?
__label__2 real numbers: I've found these batteries to be WELL worth the money. They are comparable to a good Heavy Duty (Non-Alkaline) set of batteries. I have a program on my palm pilot called FPSUtil3.5 that allows me to track the battery power curve over time:They don't hold a top end charge for very long: 85% after only 30 minutes But they really hold up well after that: 68% after 2 hrs & 15 minutes (10 minutes of nightlight) - 54% after 3 hrs - 40% after 5 hrs - 38% after 8 hrs (15 minutes of nightlight) - 28% after 10 hrs - 18% (battery warning)after 11 hrs 30 minutesSo, after 11 hours and 30 minutes of power on over a 6 day period with 25 minutes of nightlight use, they are ready for a 5 hour charge... NOT BAD, seeing as to how I'm supposed to be able to charge them 1000 times. I think I'll get my money out of them... ; )
__label__2 These batteries saved me a lot of money: I purchased 2 pairs of these batteries for my Palm Pilot IIIx because I was sick of spending a lot of money for non-rechargeable alkaline batteries. And I found them very reliable. There is no possibility of leakage with these batteries, because they are Nickel metal hydride, and they provide a large amount of energy for my Palm Pilot. Using them, I never found myself with empty batteries on the road. They are much better than NiCd batteries because they provide more then double mAh, and they do not loose their capacity with time. I would not trust any other batteries to keep my data safe, but Energizer. I use them in combination with Energizer charger for NiMH and NiCd battery family.
__label__1 Not as great as i expected them to be: I am using these for my MP3 player. I have a 1GB Creative Nano Plus. Even after a complete charge the player does not show all 3 bars for the battery strengh on the display. i can see all 3 bars with regular batteries. They last for a little lesser time than these batteries. I would recommend on trying the Sony rechargeables. They are the same price for 4 AAA batteries.
__label__2 anyone know a date?: does anyone know an approximate date for release of the box set? we have been waiting as well my whole family records the shows on dvr and its full... i like to go back and rewatch them but I dont have any more room
__label__2 Cold Case: I just started watching this show earlier this year. I can't believe I hadn't noticed it before. There was a daylong marathon of Cold Case on tv and it held my interest all day and into the night. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The way they intertwine the past with the present is brilliant, the plots are gripping and of course the music is the finishing touch. This show should be on DVD. It would be well worth the money as long as they keep the original format with the music. Great show with a great cast.
__label__1 No way to remember a giant.: The music is, to be kind - fair. Jimi is worth 3 stars but I have to subtract one star for Buddy Miles playing - boooooring. Where was Mitch Mitchel when you needed him? I LOVE Hendrix I own all the records and repurchased the music on cd later. I was inspired to play guitar because of Jimi and later the Allmans. Like most guitar players I have spent hours coping Jimis songs. Despite my honest worship of Jimi, much of his live work was many cuts below his studio efforts. He recorded 'live' in an era with poor to non-exsistant monitering systems and played at stage volumes that made recording hit or. In addition, his affection for partying and showmanship took center stage and often overshawed his playing. Want a great live recording - listen to Red House recorded 'live' in studio by the great Edie Krammer.
__label__1 Hendrix - Live At The Fillmore: There are far too many interviews and not nearly enough film footage of the concert(s). Who cares what Lenny Kravitz thinks...he's making a living ripping off Hendrix. His opinion is worthless. Eddie Kramer is the only one who's comments matter apart from Buddy Miles and Billy Cox. There must be tons of concert footage they didn't use...why??? They should have shown much more of the band playing and it would have been fabulous!
__label__1 Good guitar, not so good seller: The Bass guitar package we received was not anything like the picture or description. We ended up having to buy another amp to go with the guitar, as the one they sent was nothing like the one pictured and it was not compatible with the guitar. The seller was very slow to respond to our complaint and they lacked any type of customer service. In all fairness, the guitar is agood beginner model for our grandson.
__label__2 Very Enjoyable: I recently bought this book, and I can tell you...what a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon! I would have given the title 5 stars if it had gone into greater depth on some of the subjects, but hey...it is 100 of the World's Greatest Mysteries, they've got a lot of ground to cover here. This is not an in depth exploration of life's deeper meanings. This IS a brief telling of great mysteries that skips, like a rock on still water, from subject to subject. Purely entertaining, light reading, and a truly enjoyable vacation for the mind. Enjoy...
__label__1 Shirt Mistake: The shirt is advertised correctly as 173rd Airborne Brigade shirt but according to the pictures in the advertisement it says 173rd Airborne Division on the shirt and that is wrong!!!
__label__2 A lesson in improvisation: I remember reading a review of some posthumous Hendrix that stated "latter Hendrix is only for the staunchest". I disagree and this disc proves it. Hendrix in his last year or so really started exploring the guitar.He was not sitting still... He was getting into jazz, jamming with Miles, Roland Kirk, etc. - ready for the next step.I'm old enough to remember how boring the jazz-rock scene was in the 70s, but if Hendrix had lived he might have taken it to new (non-boring)levels.I love the improvisations on this disc. - dash of flamenco here, some Wes Montgomery there - wonderful stuff. Yes, he was exhausted, but hell I wish I could play like that when I'm fully alert! Any student of guitar and music should view this show.
__label__1 A complete waste of time, budget and poor acting: First of all... The producers know nothing about Bogota and Colombia in general. They show Bogota as a poor tropical crap (as usual by many US producers/directors) and I'm tired of this. Bogota is a beautiful 10 million people city located at 2,700 meters over the sea level, so it's a cold weather city/metropoli and not that tiny hotter than hell town shown in the movie.Very bad acting and stupid argument and dialogs.Don't get me wrong... I was born in Canada but I live in Colombia and I liked the past movies of the series, but this one is a big garbage and I will not waste my hard earned money on this. You'll not see accurately what Colombia really is and what happens here in this nice country so I recommend not to waste money on this nastiness.
__label__1 Trash: I sat through the entire movie, hated it from the start, and hated it even worse at the end. The first movie I have just thrown away.
__label__2 Nothin' to lose, nothin's for free, can't stop now iGot....: Bitches & Money by Buckcherry is a MUST HAVE for any hardcore fan.ART: The artwork on this EP is PHENOMENAL! There is a lovely collage of live shots of the band in the insert and it contains all the lyrics in both English and Japanese--a very well put together package.MUSIC: It contains 'Porno Star,' from the Time Bomb LP as well as a b-side and Dramarama cover from that album, 'Anything, Anything (I'll Give You).' The second track can also be found on the Road Trip Official Sound Track. As for the three live tracks, 'Time Bomb,' 'You,' and 'Place in the Sun,' they are from a broadcast of Rockline in Los Angeles (to the best of my knowledge). The band sounds great on the tracks, and those three tracks alone make it worth having, as they are not available on any other Buckcherry recording.
__label__1 Absolutely untrustworthy!: As another reviewer wrote, "buy it used and buy it cheap." Well, I did, and _still_ feel cheated. After receiving it just this afternoon, and spending 15 minutes scanning through it, I have to say that TAB publishers, producer of this 3rd edition, obviously needs to clean house in their proofreading department, and the author, Joseph J. Carr needs to pay more attention to the galley proofs when they're sent out. Missing diagrams, wrong diagrams to match the diagram's text, and just plain wrong information renders this book untrustworthy, and therefore worthless. Amazon won't let me award zero stars so I am forced to give it one.
__label__1 bells,whistles and aggrevation: chessmaster has chosen not to upgrade or patch 5500.this was a fairly simple chess engine that does what a chess program engine should do. set up the board, set the level of play you desire and play chess.set your timer if thats what you want .try and play cafe style chess with 8000.i do not want to spend my time reading a manual or switching disks nor do i give a damn about josh putzke learning centers ,quizes,rating evaluations,personalities (keep it simple stupid._ kiss
__label__1 Raghuraman: Not a good Chess engine. Try Fritz 6 or Shredder or Junior 6, they play much better game than this program.Shredder is the current World Chess Champion (machine). I am not sure whether ChessMaster was ever tried for World Championship. Programs like Fritz 6, Deep Fritz are used for enjoying the game and at the same time used by experts for anotating & analyzing Games. Fritz 6 was extensively used to analyze games being played during Fide World Championship etc.Bugs, crashes are not heard of those programs. They run on all the Windows OS. You get very decent programs on these sites.
__label__1 The Big Chill: If I can't buy the cd with ALL THE SONGS that were played in the movie then I won't buy it. I know one cd could cover the entire movie so why can't this be done? Does it concern copy rights and releases?
__label__2 Jerry Bruckheimer scores another sixer: The success key to all Jerry Bruckheimer films is the brilliant music score. Stuff the songs. The score is what makes a film. Be it Hans Zimmer, Trevor Rabin, Mark Mancina or Harry Gregson Williams... The guy knows what'll go. Enemy of the state starts off with a perfect theme which gets you into the action mood, then takes you deeper into the emotional mood. Not very artistic, but it's commercial score at a very high level. Go Jerry Bruckheimer!!!
__label__1 Not as good as I hoped: This unit does not have the clean and clear sound that I hoped. The adjustment of bass and treble could not achieve a good EQ overall. The volume limit is also relatively low. I have owned the Yamaha MCR series and this does not compare to those systems in terms of sound quality, rounded sound, volume or ability to drive nice headphones. After six months I decided to buy another Yamaha.
__label__2 Great quality sound: I bought the Onkyo 315 due to the great quality of sound I got in my recently purchased Onkyo Home Theater and I couldn't be happier. I am becoming a fan. I have found out that Onkyo receivers and amplifiers offer a variety of solutions that compete with most expensive devices. Onkyo is an affordable great quality of sound brand.
__label__1 Actually, this gets no stars!: Just read what "A viewer from USA" wrote (aug 2). To the point.This movie is offensive.
__label__2 Little Bear's Band: Little Bear DVD's are the next best thing to reading a story to a child...sometimes you just don't have the time. Little Bear is there to buy you some peace and quiet and entertain any preschooler with simple story lines.
__label__2 I just love it!!: It is just so meaningful to me and i love the wonderful part of the past it reminds me of my great grandmothers kitchen on sat. morning,in S.F. Calif. in the 1950s growing up ,Pearl may Penninger was her name and at the time, i never knew how much that women would impact my life!!
__label__1 too much postage for book: "Old_Time Farmhouse cooking: Rural American Recipes and Farm Lore" I was disappointed in the size of the book and definitely the cost of postage for such a small book.
__label__1 Waste of Money, Waste of Space, Waste of Time: This game has got to be the single most poorly designed RPG on the market. And I'm not even taking into account the plethora of bugs that it has. The interface cripples the game well enough, if you ask me.The ranger class is rendered totally useless, or at least no more useful than a fighter with a bow.. since you can't move any characters in your party very far away from the rest of your party at all.The story is very generic, and extremely lame. Basically.. you're dumped in some ruins with very little explanation, and you wander around killing things. And wishing the interface [wasn't so] bad.Don't buy this game. (...)
__label__1 Don't even think of buying this now...: Game is loaded with bugs. After 5 hours of play can't save without being dropped to the desktop. Installer works only on it's C:\program files\... etc. installs only in the default dir no matter where you set it to. Unplayable at this point. I'm returning mine and wait for a stable release. Yes I would like to buy it again and play it once it's fixed.Want more ? Go to www.poolofradiance.com "tech" forum and search for "roster". I can't even begin to describe the rest of the bugs, you have to visit their site before buying. That is the best $... advice I can give you all.Piece of unfinished ....I'm running AMD 1.33 Ghz ASUS A7MDDR 512mb U160 SCSI drives. Technical field as a profession.This game is unfinished. UBI SOFT starts to give me a scary feeling whenever I see it on any game box.UNFINISHED!
__label__1 Sloooow and boooring: I have really been looking forward to a new SSI D&D game. A good old fashioned dungeon crawl with awesome graphics sounded like a lot of fun. It should be. It really should be.It isn't. The problems?The customization of characters is very limited. You get to create four cookie cutter characters. You might as well start with the pre-made characters for all the thought that goes into it. The game action is terribly slow. It takes forever to get anywhere. By the time you get through a few rooms you are so bored you can't stand it. I bought this game the day it came out and I have been trying to like it every since. I have just given up. That's $40 I will never see again. Oh well lesson learned.By the way the music is pretty good and the movement (slow as it is) is fluid and life-like. I also have had no problems with crashes but then I have a fairly high end system.I wouldn't buy this game unless you are a very patient person. I reccomend instead Baldur's Gate II.
__label__1 Do not buy this game yet, wait until next year.: First and formost, this game is buggy, and has even destroyed some OS when trying to uninstall. I got mine to run and played it for about 10 hours. During this time the game slowed to a halt about 12 times. A patch would resolve this problem, but the game also suffers in gameplay. All the hoot and holler about being the first 3E computer game for D&D; can be forgotten, they butchered the rules. But there is good news, if you look past the bugs and the fact that this is not the game I was looking forward to ( A D&D; 3E game ! ), I think a great RPG might be in there somewhere. But wait until they fix the darn thing!Update: It has been about 3 months since the games release and the big patch (1.3) is not out yet. Wait until next year when (If? ) they get it fixed, it will cost less then ($) by then.
__label__1 Slow gameplay and Game crashes: I am a huge fan of the original gold box games and was hoping this would be a revamp of those. Although the turn based combat is reminicent of those old beloved games that is where the simularities end. The navigation system is terrible and slow. The combat is slow, and there is not enough random action....
__label__1 Should not have been released: I purchased this game and assumed it was finished, it was not. I set up my system with a minimal amount of space on C: drive, and this program must be installed on C:. Even if you download the patch, the installer still looks for enough space on C: to install. I wish I could give you a review of the actual play of the game, but like I said I will not be able to play it until Ubisoft puts out another install patch, or I re-partition my system(not likely, either one). Unless you have lots of space on your C: drive (minimum 630 MB), don't get this, you'll never be able to install.
__label__1 If I were you I'd pass on this one...: I played the original Pool of Radiance on my Commodore 64 back in 1989. Naturally, I've been looking forward to this updated sequel for months. Ordered it, received it, eagerly installed it... all I can say is what a disappointment.The storyline is generic and uninteresting, the interface is cludgy and unintuitive, and there are several things that are just plain annoying. I don't know if I can bring myself to finish this game...Like the original 1988 version of Pool of Radiance, you will waste a lot of time fighting long meaningless battles for little or no experience points.All negative aspects aside, the graphics and animations are great. If you don't care about role-playing and an interesting storyline, and just want to run around spending all of your time fighting for no reason, then this game is for you.
__label__1 I Want A Refund!: After the anticipation I felt for this game, all I can feel now is bewilderment. How could this game have been released? I have played for about four hours and have given up. The gameplay is horrible. It is slow, the cursor movement is choppy and at first level my sorcerer has no spells. I am unfamiliar with the 3rd edition rules of D&D, but I always thought a sorcerer would get at least one spell so it must be a game flaw. I have not found one single quality in this game that would make it remotely fun to play.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. You will be better off playing Baldur's gate, BG2 or Icewind dale again. If you are a fan of these games, as I am, you will be sorely disappointed with Pool of Radiance.
__label__2 Defending the Game: Ok, so many people ripped apart this game. Personally, I didn't think it was that bad. My game has only crashed once, much less then BG2 when it first came out. It's one of those games that gets really bad if you don't like it.Problems:Long combat (slow game)Little choices (example you can cast level 8 spells but theres only one option for a class)Interface (takes time to figure out what things do)The manual is little helpKnowledge of D&D; is importantNot much of an RPGPositives:Great GraphicsRuns Smoothly (No jerky movements)Cool dungen crawl systemFun combat (Turns allow you to enjoy spells)Turn based system allows you to enjoy combatMany mini quests in a dungenmany itemsOverall I enjoyed the game, then again I got a great deal. It is definatly not worth [the money], but if you find it for a cheap price, I recommend getting it.
__label__1 Garbage: What a peace of garbage, won't register, nothing wrong with my internet connection. Won't down load, hours of frustration, took a couple hours off to cool off, try again, then the same old crap. This is going back. Only reason it gets one star is because there's nothing less.
__label__2 GREAT BUT DATED 3 DISC SET IS NICE BUT......................: I am a big fan of Disney films. The animated classics will be forever imprinted in my mind. I do have a huge problem with any censorship! Unfortunately, the people at Disney decided to buckle under to it, because of a few cry babies complaining about racial stereotypes in some of their films. I know I am not the first to say this,but really are these people serious? I am Italian and German, do you think I have not seen my share of stereotyping in my 45 years on this planet? Why hasn't Stromboli from Pinochhio been altered for it's depiction of an Italian? It seems we are very selective with what we censor..hhmmm!I don't mind it because I know the characterization is just that and it doesn't reflect the entire race! Please stop censorship of any kind especially regarding these historic works of art. You can not change history you can only learn from it!
__label__1 One box was not usable: I purchased the product in February 2012. The product contained three boxes. Two of the three boxes were fine. However, one of the boxes did not have any liquid in it. It had the color base but not the liquid, therefore, I couldn't use it. The cap was tight, it didn't spill, it was never filled because it was completely dry!
__label__1 Certainly not worth $10 each: We use 9v rechargable batteries at our church. These will only last 2 hours in a wireless microphone. They will barely last 2 hours in our wireless audio packs (ear buds) and when I use them for my electric bass wireless transmitter device they barely get through 30 minutes of use per charge. Since we have three services and practice that morning as well, these batteries do not cut it.We found these Digimate 280mAh rechargeable 9v's that work much better... we can get two complete weekends from one charge on these... plus, they were only $5 each.
__label__2 Like it alot: I really do like the CD. Although it's not my favorite of theirs. It does have alot of good songs on it, I find myself listening to the other CD's more.
__label__2 Great Item.: This USB wireless adapter worked and still works like a charm. Installation is a brease and works on every computer and laptop I tried it.Pros:1. Great operation2. Catches excellent signal over long distance due to the external antenna3. Virtually plug and playCons:1. The little prop-up antenna can break easy. The plastic is not too strong2. If you switch USB ports it will ask for the driver again!3. Does not work with Linux, but I did not fight with it too much!
__label__1 Not a very good receiver: I have a Netgear MA101 802.11b USB adapter sitting next to the WG121 adapter. The MA101 consistently receives a stronger signal by FAR compared to the WG121. Both adapters are less than 20 feet from the access point. The WG121 cannot sustain a good connection (i.e a relative signal strength of 5-8 on a scale of 10). The MA101 indicates a perfect connection (10 on a scale of 10) ALWAYS. I will put up with the slower speed to get a stable, consistent, strong connection. The WG121 is being returned and I will stick with the MA101 (USB1.1, 802.11b adapter).
__label__1 constant lockups: I've had nothing but trouble with this adapter on my system. My system locks up constantly if it is connected. Apparently, a lot of other people with Athlon systems are having the same problem - so buyer beware.
__label__2 A MUST Read, the best: This a a book for all of us that are looking to find God and not sure how to get their. John Eldredge is an author who shares his spiritual heart with your searching heart. I have read 3 of his books, and he is a genuine, spiritual follower of Jesus Christ. He talks to me through his words in a way that I can relate. This is a 6 star book on a scale of 5. Best money you will spend.
__label__2 Powerful Application: This book weaves the Gospel message alongside all of the great stories and films over the last fifty years. I found it to be inspirational and even gave a copy to each of my children with a reminder that their lives are part of a bigger story. "His-Story" because our personal history really is about God's story for each one of us. It's a quick read, but one you won't forget because of so many powerful life applications.
__label__1 it took a heroic effort to finish it...: yeah, so...i did want to see how it turned out but the ending was mostly so @#@# cliche... it's not the increduality of the stripper hooking up with the nerd mortician but just everything else so predictable. there was some potential. but it didn't pan out...about 1/2 way through the film i was tracking how much time was left and using my utmost personal control to not Fast Forward to the end.that movie plot technic, very-loosely-interrelated collage of stories that make up a single film...it's worn thin already. eg, forest whitaker never meets jessica biel in the film but they both related to the mortician at different times--but did the mortician (being the only mortician in the film) get the boys body? the tranny's body?
__label__1 Had to return: The dvd was mislabeled with the wrong zone. It was listed as Zone 1 but when I received the dvd it was marked for a different zone that I couldn't play in the USA. I had planned to purchase the same dvd again but the price had more than doubled and tripled. Needless to say, I was very disappointed especially because of the misleading information given on my original purchase. The movie itself is a very good story with excellent acting; humor, romance, and fantasy all rolled into one. The special effects are realistic. I would recommend the movie for anyone who likes fantasy type stories such as Harry Potter or The Lord of The Rings. It is that type of genre and very well done.
__label__2 I don't know why I love this movie so much...: It's hilarious, that's why! My friend Kat first introduced me to this movie about a year ago, and now I can't stop watching it! It's got a great storyline and that stupid song will get stuck in your head for weeks! :D (...)
__label__1 I don't understand: I honestly don't understand these reviews. I bought this DVD because of a link to the 10th Kingdom. I tried to watch it several times, but could not even get through it once. It is terrible. What were these other reviewers watching?
__label__2 Goblets--a great game!: This is a beautiful game that involves lots of strategy. We have one at home and I purchased this one as a gift for my nephews. The price here was great, so we are all happy "Gobblers"!
__label__2 Terrific game!: I bought Gobblet for my 7 year old, who loves checkers and tic-tac-toe. Not only he loves Gobblet, his dad loves it even more! What a great game for the whole family!
__label__1 RIP OFF!: Becareful when you order picture is deceiving. Item sent to me was plastic, colorful colors, and for a very young childs eye. Not for a 12 yr. old. Then when I sent it back only credited alittle over $5.10,I payed alot more. I was not sent the item in the picture. Major disappointment!
__label__2 This is a great family game!! Highly recommended!: It's a fun game, and it definitely challenges people of all ages. We love it, and have bought it for many of our extended family members as gifts.
__label__2 Fun for the whole family: This game really gets you thinking about strategy. I think it is probably a great way to prepare kids for a game like chess. My husband and I also enjoy playing this game. It is well packaged, not in a cardboard box like most games. The directions are pretty good, although we were confused at first about what kind of movements were allowed, but we seemed to get it all figured out. A very calm, fairly fast game. Would be a great game for much older folks, too.
__label__1 Poppin' the Hood: I originally heard a cut from this album and thought it would be a great comedy album for my collection. Unfortunately that was the only funny track on this album. It did not measure up to my expectations. Very few tracks are funny and once listened to it is better off filed in the trash.
__label__2 Good stuff: I practice kung fu, tai chi, and chi gung. I'm not a Reiki practitioner, but the music is soothing for my meditation and tai chi forms. This particular CD is very good. Every song is almost exactly 5 minutes long. The song changes signal when you should switch to the next Reiki position if you are using it but for me it is good for slow chi gung excercises. Still, it's relaxing music for any situation: the car, the office, etc. I listen to it everywhere and suggest you listen to it, too.
__label__2 Not a Textbook: This book is not a regular textbook or even a "non-traditional" textbook. It really is just what it claims to be and nothing more: 13 tips on how to improve your Japanese. It is fun and helpful, but it's not a book for total beginners. You need to know some Japanese before it can really work for you.I really likeMaking Sense of Japanese: What the Textbooks Don't Tell You, a nice companion to this book. I own both of these, and I think I got more out of "Making Sense" actually. Both books are ABOUT learning Japanese; they're not directly teaching you to speak the language. Just keep that in mind when making your purchase decision.
__label__2 A super guide to people of all ages!: As an anime lover and general Japanese enthusiast, I think this book is very intelligent and fun to work with. There are only two problems: a) the price b)they dont teach you how to read kanji!
__label__1 Music is cooking; sound quality is stone cold: This is a great live album; my only complaint is the sound quality - I have played this disc on a decent system (dedicated CD transport, tube amps, and beyond-modest speakers), and find that instrument separation and sound stage are virtually NON-EXISTENT!! I have played tons of other Miles' albums on the same system and most of them sound great - especially the Columbia/Sony releases, remastered or not.I strongly recommend the "Highlights from Plugged Nickel" instead, unless you don't mind hearing the great(est) Jazz live performance using one ear.
__label__2 AMAZING AND SO MUCH FUN: So much fun i got this for christmas and lately its been " hey do you want to play hockey? " it is big and fun and it comes with two goalie sticks (one for each goal) and four sticks ( one for each person ) it is so much fun!!!!
__label__2 Goldfinger DVD: well this dvd is jsut awesome and i dont know what that dude is saying that blink fans cant appreaciate this kind of music cuz im a blink fan too and i love goldfinger's music its like totally awesome this dvd is the best! its got tons of like extras and old live shows totally amazing if you are a goldfinger fan you should definatly get it!
__label__1 Maybe Chinese Drywall is Easier to Cut: I've cut narrow strips no problem. No problem, except I have to measure with a tape everytime I change size because the built in rule cuts narrow. I have found anything bigger than 3 inch doesn't cut all the way through. I'm cutting 1/2 inch and have the wheels set all the way in. The u shaped piece of metal bends and I have to use a razor. It makes a nice straight line to cut along though. I guess I should have paid 3 times as much for the American stripper.
__label__2 Wonderful Performances: I've been a fan of Ms. Carlson since the mid 70's when she performed locally in rock bands. Her move to jazz standards was the right move (not to knock her ability to rock). This is a wonderful album with strong performances by her and her accompanying musicians. I think it's stronger than her critically acclaimed Christmas albumThis Christmas ... my favorite things. I've listened to this album literally hundreds of times and it still wears very well.
__label__2 Help me, please....: I'm frequently up in the middle of the night with one of our two babies, and I just became completely hooked on this show. I DVR all the episodes in case we all happen to be sleeping, and I can't wait to see each new episode. The problem, however, is that it's not listed on the DHLTH channel at all after tomorrow (07/27/07). Mandy Patinkin's character just had his license reinstated after a brief suspension and hearing. He and Diane Venora's character just broke up. What happens next???? Someone help me, please....."Chicago Hope-ful"
__label__2 Release them all and I shall buy!: Mandy Patinkins is a very underrated actor: I would love to see him in this show! To see a master like E.G. Marshall in quality television towards the end of his working career would also be truly amazing. Hector Elizondo is always underrated, and I always thought that Adam Arkin was George Clooney... They look the same. I thought Clooney was on Chicago Hope and that was what made him famous. I do think ER is probably one of the finest TV shows ever, so would be curious to see how Hope pans out if it ever comes out. I haven't seen St. Elsewhere yet, and am hesitant to buy the first season the only reason being that if I like it, I would be annoyed if they don't release the following seasons.
__label__1 OH !! Where are the lights !!!: DeLonghi DCH1030 Ceramic HeaterDON"T BUY THIS SPACE HEATER !!! UNLESS, you don't mind partial outages throughout your house. It's just too STRONG and it tripped over and over parts of our home - EEHHHHH EVEN THE TVs and the PC!!! Finally had to call an electricn, and we all know how expensive THEY can be. But, he asked if we had AHY new electirical things in the house. We didn't even THINK of the space heater. The electican just happened to see the space heater on the floor by my PC (COOL AREA< HERE) and immediately picked it up. Sure enough, it was a 1500W. IT WAS THE CULPRIT !! I have run other 1500W space heaters, but there is JUST SOMETHING about this little lemon. Cost us $89 for the electrican (cheap around here). You are warned !!!!
__label__1 Don't Be Fooled!: Don't be fooled. This book has a title very similar to The Ultimate Book of Kid Concocitons book I saw on PBS. I bought this book thinking it was the PBS book and was very upset. I'm sure I am not the only one making this mistake. The projects in this book are out dated and seem to be the same old things that have been around for years, Buyer beware! I would bet the publisher did this to trick people into buying there book.
__label__1 virtual makeover: i got this product with no information and i can see it on my computer but it wont let me add any photos. i was getting it for fun, but it has only been frusterating.
__label__1 When GOD doesn't heal???: When God doesn't heal?? Let's ask Jesus (the One who bore ALL of our sicknesses and pains) about that one.It's not God who doesn't heal us, it's us who don't receive the healing that He already provided through the cross of Christ and by His grace.What a completely disrespectful thing to say about God!"When God doesn't heal"...another lie of religion.
__label__1 very unhappy: I expected to recieve a book, not a small pamphlet for $128.00. I had the great grace to have Msgr. Turro as an instructor in seminary and seek anything he has written; but not 24 pages for $128.00!! When contacting the seller, and Amazon to return it, I have not had any response. This is the first time I have ever had any problems returning anything with Amazon. I caution anyone using this seller.
__label__2 an unknown gift...: I'm not really into this kind of music, but this harp music is very elusive and well crafted. The pieces sing to you and take you on a journey.
__label__2 As always, amazing music: I love this album. Several of the songs were remixes or new approaches to ones I already know and love, while the rest were completely new to me. However, as a big fan of Des'ree, the new songs do not disappoint. A great album, even though it only plays on a few of my CD players!
__label__2 Art is eternal: The combination of Miles Davis and Gil Evans is unequaled. The music they and gifted sidemen created is timeless and brilliant. And it swings, rocks, grooves, and kills even after over 50 years.
__label__2 Awesome Grip!!: This is such an awesome grip. It made my 15 years old Ruger P89 looks brand new! Not only it looks great, but it fits great. It also feels better shooting my P89 for sure. I highly recommend this grip on your Ruger P series.
__label__2 Great on my Ruger P89: The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it arrived over a week late. Aside from that, I love it. It's easy to install (just remove the two screws and pop it on). It fits great and looks good too. Most importantly, it fits PERFECTLY in my hand. I absolutely love it.
__label__2 Great Product for everyone: So I bought this funny looking saddle because I had cyst on my lady parts and could no longer use a regular bike seat. No fun. This bike seat took all the pressure off said "sensitive bits" and is actually more comfortable in general than "normal" bike seats, medical problems or not. I have ridden it for about 6 months now and taken the bike out on a 5 hour trip, as well as short term city biking. Over all it is of excellent quality. Yes there are some problems with this seat. you loose the ability to steer with your legs, and on long bike rides your thighs will be a bit sore. BUT you will be less sore than you would have been on a regular seat. and your sensitive areas will be just fine.Over all I highly recommend this seat for all.
__label__1 It was not what i expected!!!: THE BOOK "MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE" WRITTEN BY JENNY K. WAS AS MANY PEOPLE WROTE IN THEIR REVIEWS, "AN INSULT TO HUMAN INTELLIGENCE,"BUT THE ONE WRITTEN BY NICHOLAS SPARKS HAPPENS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT TOUCH TO IT, MAKING READERS ALL OVER THE WORLD SAVOR THE STORY. I HAVE READ "MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE" BY SPARKS ABOUT 6 TIMES BECAUSE I LOVED IT THE FIRST TIME AND HAD ME CRAVING FOR IT 5 MORE TIMES. BUT LETS BE NICE AND AT LEAST GIVE JENNY K THE CREDIT FOR WRITING IT...
__label__1 Nothing New here: Seems like the message of this documentary could be delivered in 10 minutes. Every thing needs to be made into an 1.5 hours, just get to the point.
__label__2 Ingredients: Knocked my socks off. This is absoluty a must see if you wonder about why they re putting aresnic on meat at grocery stores, why we have flourine - absolutly toxic mass-scale industrial waste from the fertilizer industry - in our water supply, or why genetically modified seeds are grown into obscenely larger plants and then sprayed with toxic weed killer on a weekly basis, for months upon months. -Round up- -In your food that you eat- Think about it.
__label__2 Essentials of Sociology - great book!: The book is written very well and is filled with tons of information! The numerous real world stories within each chapter help readers see the concepts in sociology the textbook introduces applied to the real world, and the stories are incredibly interesting. Recommended for anyone who is interested in studying sociology.
__label__1 I really struggled with the heroine: I finished this book yesterday and even after a day I'm still irritated by the h's attitude. Again considering the time period, I found the h's attitude very 21st century. We are told constantly how 'different' her family is and how her mother just wants her to have a love match. I sincerely doubt that any parent of the day would have gone to such trouble to get their daughter alone with a young, handsome and eligible male.Inevitably the h sleeps with the H but refuses to marry him. Of course the thought of pregnancy never enters her mind (although later it does). The fact that she continually doubted the H's love for her, and he professed it quickly, and if I were him I would have found someone more deserving.I bought the trilogy, which I've put aside for now because I was so put off by Violet. I do like the author though and enjoyed The Temptation trilogy so I'll probably pick up the second book at a later date.
__label__1 Lamplight 52664 Farmers Lantern: This lamp really was not what I thought it was suppose to be.It has to use oil. I wanted battery.
__label__1 Typical of the Series: One of the problems with Enterprise is the accusation it ignores establised canon. The premise of this story: if Vulcans kill does it betray the teachings of Surak has already been addressed in The Original Series by Spock.
__label__2 great gift..: I loved everything about this ring..unique design, comfortable, nice weight. I received it on X-mas eve and wasn't expecting to receive it in time for the holiday..bonus. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the sizing, it runs a little large. My overall experience with this company was excellent.
__label__1 Cracks Under Pressure: It's unfortunate that a PDA with so much promise is built so poorly. The case chips easily, and the surface you write on cracks very easily. I've already had to replace one to the tune of $80. If you plan on using your PDA as a truly portable computer, on that will be with you on the road, I'd highly recommend you look at other options, like the Palm Pilot, Compaq IPAQ or the Hewlett Packard Vornada, all sturdier offerings. The Handspring cracks under even the slightest pressure.
__label__2 Absolutely brilliant!!!!!!!: I have been a fan of No Doubt for about 8 years now, and this is just a little something to show how much they have achieved.The singles album is something everyone should own, track to track it is pure genius, from upbeat rocky classics that instantly put you in a good mood to slower beats such as running, that just make you smile and relax you.Then the everything in time album, is just as good it contains rare songs and remixes, and they all hold a unique catchiness.However the dvd's really top off this package, the videos dvd is pure genius the videos are amazing to watch, and the live in the tragic kingdom just gives you an example of how cool they are live.If you are a no doubt fan, you must own this. Enjoy :)
__label__2 Worth the price of admission just for Cleese's eulogy to Graham Chapman!!: I loved this set. Things I'd never seen, dirt about the filming of Holy Grail, Brian, & Meaning Of Life. Cleese in a dirndl was quite fetching, & his eulogy of Graham Chapman was almost worth the price of admission. Too bad there were no llamas, & no small marsupials ate the delicious eucalyptus leaves, yum, yum. G'day, Bruce!
__label__2 Happy rats: There are far less things in this product my rats wont eat. It's hard to find rat food that isnt all seed which they wont touch. They like most of what is in this.
__label__2 A book that won't dissapoint you.: Awesome book! I learned more about the Holy Spirit and how He affects my life daily than I have learned in the 30+ years of walking as a Christian. I was in two Bible study settings for the study of this book and each one saw something new and exciting about the Holy spirit and His presence in our lives today. I highly recommend this book.
__label__1 UMAX Astra 6450 vs. Microsoft XP Home: Purchased 6450 in June, tested briefly with Microsoft ME. Upgraded to XP Home in January but during installation discovered products are not compatible. I get no help or encouragement from either UMAX or Miscrosoft.
__label__2 End of the story...: I absolutely love this book. I originally found this book at a library, borrowed it, renewed it at least 4 times, and I bought it so I CAN KEEP IT FOREVER.Amazing book, it's like Playboy magazine or food network magazine for me.. makes my eyes delighted (:
__label__2 Beautiful pictures: but not a book to learn about goldfish. A nice gift book for someone who has goldfish though.
__label__1 The lion terrified my son!!: My son is a huge fan of "Hide and Seek Elmer". I bought "Elmer's Friends" thinking he would love this as well. There is a lion in this book that has the most frightening face. My son would start to cry the page before in anticipation of the upcoming lion. I tore that page out of the book and now my child can enjoy this book again. The other animals are fun, but the lion is terrifying!
__label__1 Good Information, Poor Quality: Just received this book after waiting 2 months for it. I purchased it because it is often referenced in other CM books.After just scanning through the book, I can tell that it contains some valuable information. One big minus is the index consists of blank pages, which is really bad for a technical book.The physical quality of the book is very poor. Cheap binding, cheap paper, cheap type. Except for the nice cover, it looks like it was thrown together at Kinkos.What really irks me is that I paid almost $50 for this book. This is something I would pay $10 for a PDF download.
__label__2 Would I Measure Up?: This movie had haunted me ever since I first saw it on Los Angeles TV when I was twelve years old. Being the son of a career soldier it was always expected that some day I would serve in the Army. I always wondered whether I would measure up and be able to lead men in combat.In 1991 I found myself leading a team of American soldiers advising an army in a very deadly war against a communist insurgency. Leadership in combat is the ultimate challenge and when my tour ended, I felt no different then how Richard Basehart's character did at the end of this movie.Though a bit dated, this movie is my all time favorite and definitely a keeper.
__label__1 A dissappointment!: Frankly I'm quite dissapointed in this film. It's in black and white, which actually is no problem for me since I enjoy classic war films. The dissappointmnet is that the whole movie seems to be shot in a studio!!! and a very small studio! Really dissapointed. Also nothing really special about the story.
__label__1 Korean war movie: In my opinion this was a terrible movie. It deals with a corporal (Richard Basehart) who has leadership issues, i.e. will he be able to lead if he is put in that situation. A better movie would be "Hell is for Heroes" which also deals with the Korean war, or "Retreat Hell" starring Frank Lovejoy. Don't waste your money or time on this one.
__label__2 i think this is a very good Cd: the only thing wrong with this Cd is that they have to many skits. they need to cut down on them
__label__1 wooooo: THis album is so Kool-aid pumping sweeeeet it gave me a cavity. RedMans heart pumps Kool-aid on this joint. Its tired....Burn it... Give me MC EIHT.
__label__1 Oh man, what a waste of a good Godzilla title!!!: Godzilla's Revenge, what comes to mind when you think of that. I thought Godzilla becomes evil and devastates Tokyo while fighting monsters that idea is much better than the one in this movie. This is all in a boy's dream...what the heck? Now I enjoy Godzilla movies,I even liked Son of Godzilla but this movie is a disgrace. Why would Minilla be Barney and talk? What's with this bully nonsense? I wanted rubber monsters action, the only good point of this movie is Godzilla verses Gabara that's the only thing that gave this an extra star because everything else is stock footage.
__label__1 Oh The Pain!!!!!! Have Mercy!!!!!: Oh my gosh!!!! I have now seen how bad a movie can get! I mean, where's the "Revenge" here people?! What was Toho thinking? Minilla talks????? This movie does not have any monsters in it besides the ones in the boy's head. If you want to see a movie with cool monsters you will regret it. Now, if you're looking for the closest thing to Tellatubbies (besides Barney) this is definetly what you're looking for. This is not a Godzilla movie in the slightest.
__label__1 Godzilla as, Barney?: Well, almost. This movie is definitly geared towards younger audiences. Most of the fight scenes are stock footage from other films, the plot is kiddy and the dubbing is worse then usual. There are two reasons to get this movie. One, if you are a Godzilla fan and want to introduce your children to the series, this is a good way to do it. This is a great way to spend some quality time with your child and maybe pass on some of what you like about the Godzilla series. The other reason? If your a collector or completionist, buy the video, watch it once and bury it on a deep shelf. Every self proclaimed Godzilla fan should have to watch this video once. It reminds us that Godzilla is for all ages. And it shows that maybe the American Godzilla wasn't that bad. After all, it could have been based on this.
__label__2 A Stunning SciFi Action Novel !!!!!: Rarely does a book come my way that I actually cant wait to see the outcome of. Crossworld is one of those rare and compelling stories that anybody with an open mind will enjoy.The story itself is top notch with hints of The Matrix and Blade scattered throughout. Robert Aldrich continually keeps things at a fast and enjoyable pace without sacrificing genious storytelling and immersive detail. Just wait until you witness the awesome hardcore action sequences which are beautifully crafted in every chapter.I fully recommend this adventure tale to anyone with a love of science fiction, anime, fantasy, and breathtaking action. I am eagerly awaiting the following volumes.
__label__2 Keep out a picker, but not a kicker: We still use these around the house at all entrance doors. They grasp under the door knob and plant a rubber footer on the floor. If the floor is smooth, like tile or vinyl, the footer and the floor need to be kept clean; otherwise it can slip when forced. I tried getting in once while the thing was in place and I could not do it until I really forced it for a while. I'm a big guy, but I think anyone could get past it if they were determined. Therefore, we use it as a way to keep lock pickers out, and we don't expect it to prevent someone from kicking in the door. There are other devices for that purpose, for people who live in those areas where burglaries are committed by serious career criminals. The only thing we get around here might be the wayward teen who might take something if it's easy. So, I cannot give it 5 stars; it will not keep out someone who is determined to get in. Otherwise, it is sturdy and easy to use.
__label__1 False sense of security: I bought this item because I am a stay at home mom with a hand disability. We live in a rental apartment and I am very scared to have people break into my home while my husband is off truck driving. First off, it is very sturdy "looking" but my 1 year old son was able to dislodge it from the door with little effort. My husband was also able to "break into" the door after losing his key to the garage by simple pushing the door back and forth twice to dislodge the device. It is good if you are paraoid but know that it doesn't really help prevent a break in, but it will buy a few seconds and alarm me to an intruder.
__label__2 Great Security for the Price: Definitely a good buy. I use it for my front door, and it doesn't slip or budge an inch when someone tries to open the door. I feel much more secure since I live alone in an apartment. I've recommended it to friends and family who are pleased with their purchase as well.
__label__1 Nothing to Compare to Other Pinball Game: This game is...well just another video game. Nothing like a real pinball game and im sorry but some people that wrote review on this game should try some real paintball simulator like platinum pinball. I would pay about a dollard for this game...maybe less
__label__1 This is a 2lb hammer - NOT 7lb as the title states!: Title says it all. Somebody doing data entry messed this one up... It's a 2lb dead-blow hammer, not a 7 lb as the title and description claims. (You can google the model number, or zoom in on the picture to verify - the label on the handle says 2lb.) Returned for a prompt refund.
__label__2 Pretty Cool, but not The Whole Way: This movie ROCKS!! My aunt bought me this and I've loved it!She knows I like Sonic. I gave it a 4 outta 5 'cuase of Sonic's voice acting. At the beginning, he sounds relaxed and all cool. But in the middle of the movie, he sounds like an Englishman! What's up with that? And also, it's too dang short! I just want to see more after it's over! One pro is that catchy, "Look Alike" tune at the end. They should release that song as a single sooner or later. Anyway, it's a great movie and any sonic fan should get it. P.S. Who's cooler than Tails?!
__label__1 this movie sucked: i have seen many sonic cartoons over the years and this movie was the worst. the animation was crappy and the character voices cracked. over all it was a bad movie i wouldnt recamend it at all
__label__1 Very disappointed with the Prism: I purchased a Visor Prism as a Christmas gift. When it arrived, I installed the hardware and software exactly as instructed in the manual. The Visor would perform a hot sync, but would not install any applications. After nearly a dozen phone calls to Handspring's technical support, they were still unable to correct the problem, despite the fact that this case was "escalated" three times by Handspring's technical support department.This entire fiasco has taken close to a month. I don't anticipate buying any additional products from Handspring. I suggest going with a Palm...it's more reliable.
__label__1 handspring prism: the product worked, but the batteries are no good, in only a day the batteries drain and the memory is lost! other than that i received everything i was promised!
__label__1 To bulky.: I am going to keep my review short and to the point. Like the palm IIC this portable won't fit in you pocket. Its to bulky. You would be better buying a sony CLIE, or palm 505 before investing your money in the prism.
__label__1 Wheeler is no Netter!: This book is wordy and lacks organization. It is full of awkward sentences, rambling paragraphs and has no sense of continuity. The diagrams are not labeled, of low quality and seemingly outdated. There are much better anatomy references out there and I suggest looking into the other literature. Wheeler's text simply demonstrates the need for a Frank Netter of sorts- someone who can do for Oral Anatomy what Dr. Netter did for Gross Anatomy. I'm actually considering writing my own text one day so that future students will be able to spend more time focusing on anatomy rather than the minutia and distractions that this book is full of. If you need to learn Oral Anatomy this is not the book that will help.
__label__2 Hoyle Board Games has turned the family into addicts!: Hoyle Board games 2001 is a fabulous collection of thoroughly enjoyable and addicting family board games. These great games include beautiful graphic versions of Backgammon, Mancala, Chinese Checkers, Chess, Dominoes, Pachisi, Mah Jong Tiles and the addicting Mah Jong Gravity. Also, there are great versions of Battle Ships, Master Mind, Connect Four, Yahtzee and Chutes and Ladders--all disquised by easily identified title variations. A fun game called Placer Racer is a family favorite. It isn't really a board game - more of an arcade game--shooting colored balls trying to make matches of three while you race against a steadily decreasing game area. This collection of board games is great and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants fun, wholesome, clean fun for the family.
__label__2 All in one: I couldn't believe that there was a box set of this series. It is a must have for thoes who have dabbled in the Method workouts. Each of these workouts flow with one another and having the box set means less money and you can follow through with the total workout. I love this series because they are a are fun to do, combining dance, yoga, weights, and Pilates to give you a challenging full body workout that doesn't stress out your body. These tapes are set up so that if you don't have a lot of time to workout, you can just do one section and you will still sweat. You can also mix and match certian routines to keep your workout interesting. I would recomend these tapes for anyone who is tired of repitition workouts and who are ready to have fun and be creative while sweating away.
__label__1 Life Source UB-512 Advanced Memory Wrist Auro: Totaly inadequate. I take the blood pressure following directions and I get 3 different readings . I have been a nurse for over 50 years, and I can't use.
__label__2 So far so good - nice product: Received item quickly, well packaged. Popped batteries in and went to town. Works very well. Adaptable to various size wrists.
__label__2 Beautiful bed!: This bed is good quality. The matress pad, blanket and pillow are cute and perfect for this bed. My girls use it and love it. The doll is so real and sweet its great to have a nice place to put her. Its easy to put together and can be taken a part easily for storage. I think this is the second thing to get after buying Annabell.
__label__1 macross 2 the movie: this movie blows! i wasted my money on this one. i watched it and the whole plot just sucks. why would i watch a movie where the main weapon is a song. Do not waste your time with this one.
__label__2 It has ON/OFF switch: ON/Off switch was the reason why I picked this light.9 out of 10 similar lights don't have it and without ityou have to unplug it from USB just to turn it off.Works great for my needs, fair quality. Buy it.
__label__1 what you want is the fourth edition: I'm sure this book was great in the 90s, but this is the 21st century, when you can buy the fourth edition. There has been a ton of advancement between 1994 and 2002.
__label__1 good illustrations, bad writing: I don't understand any of these other reviewers. The book has lots of colorful illustrations, and the thickness make the book look comprehensive, but the writing seems to need more organization. Surely it could have been written more concisely. Incredibly boring to read through.
__label__1 Disapointing: Your editorial review is correct but understates the technical problem with the sound in this whole series. The excess reverberation, poor audio production, and the English accents make this almost indecipherable by North Americans. I get the feeling that the director is very visually oriented, but he tries to get cute and technical. The trick shots are just too contrived. The cast does not seem to be having any fun, the hallmark of a good G&S performance. They are not sharing the joke because they are so pre occupied with their technique.I far prefer the series done at Stratford in Canada rather than this candidate for Madame Tusaud's museum.
__label__2 tasty recipes with few ingredients: I've used this cookbook several times and every dish I've made has come out great. The thing I like best is that most of the recipes have relatively few ingredients and simple steps. I have several crockpot cookbooks and I've found this one to be the best.
__label__1 rather disapointing: This collection would be fun if all the games could be played head to head online, but they can't. The pool game is fun but you are much better off buying Sierra's Maximum Pool instead.
__label__1 Bad analog recording, Background noise for digital music: I purchased this product mainly for recording my LP collection into digitial format using my laptop. I thought that this could be a good product for that purpose, until I used it. This product could not record properly from analog input. It's even much much worse than recording using laptop's analog input. Not only the recording level was so low, but also the recorded mp3 or wma had so much artificial noise that it was unusable. I used USB2 connection all the time. It seems to me that USB2 doesn't help any better.Playing digital music was relatively OK, except that it produced slight background white noise. Still directly connecting from my laptop to the speaker produced much better result.I wonder what the purpose of this device might be ?Not recommended.
__label__1 berlitz employees write these reviews: berlitz employees write most of the gushing reviews posted on this site. Beware that there are much less expensive products, that there is nothing revolutionary about these products, and that you will find less expensive variants elsewhere. Be cost conscious and know that you will not learn a language from a cd rom
__label__2 Dale Bruning.... smooooth.....: I once read, in the liner notes of an Ed Bickert album, about how refreshing it is to hear jazz that is "quiet and pretty". Such is the case here. No pyrotechnic chops or blistering arpeggios. Just simple, good, tasty jazz lines. Moore and Bruning blend together perfectly, as they have done before. If you're into the likes of Jim Hall, Ed Bickert, or Royce Campbell, you can't go wrong with this CD.
__label__1 Beware it is a single: I purchased this CD for 11.99 not realizing that it was a single. It may have been labeled, but at that price who would think it was a single. It is now selling for about 1/3 of that price which is much more reasonable. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until after I opened it. It was very disappointing to say the least.
__label__2 post-war germany and it's past haunting it. rating: 7: Frank Defelitta wrote a good story on a holocaust survivor/mental patient on a killing spree to advenge the wrongs of the past. it has a good storyline and takes you into 1960's germany and Israel and you get a feeling of the time. The relationship between the detective and female holocaust survivor leaves the reader confused and disappointed. I still pull my copy out & read it every few years.
__label__2 Love the Balance Buddy!: Best money ever spent! We tried for a day or two the old fashioned way with me holding the back of the seat and had the worst time. When we used the balance buddy my daughter learned in 2 days! No bending over for me and she was so much more stable.
__label__1 Strike Out: Mr. Woodcock had such great potential but failed to deliver. There are some real heavy hitters in the cast.Billy Bob Thornton has the capacity to make any film a classic when directed properly. Although, he had his moments in this one.Susan Sarandon was probably not right for the part...OR...was right for the part if the film was executed correctly. She is a gifted and elegant actress who can make a role striking and memorable. This role was beneath her to say the least.Seann William Scott is a modern comedy genuis. He has the look, the resume and the chops to take a movie to the next level. He was also probably not right for this role. He belongs in Hollywood blockbusters, not forgettable films like Mr. Woodcock.Three terrific actors combined into one film should have been a winner but just couldn't do it. Three strikes.
__label__1 Abysmal: Sean William Scott, Billy Bob Thornton, and Susan Sarandon are capable, if not excellent, actors. In fact, I'm certain that if anyone with lesser Hollywood standing had been in this it would never have been made.Other than a couple of funny lines delivered by supporting actor Ethan Supplee, there was nothing to laugh at. It's "Bad Santa" Thornton watered down to the least, while everyone else on screen is wooden and bland, in a movie so predictable that I have a hard time believing it was even written.Here's the deal: Small town boy makes good, goes home for accolades, meets mothers new boyfriend, hates mothers new boyfriend, decides he's being selfish and works to get them back together.I don't recommend buying it, I don't recommend renting it. If you're bedridden when it comes on TBS at 8am and the batteries in your remote are dead, that should be your only excuse for watching it.
__label__1 Mr. Woodcock is no Bad Santa!: Mr. Woodcock was quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Seann William Scott, Billy Bob Thornton, and Susan Sarandon, among others.A best-selling author returns home to pick up a prestigious local award only to find his mom dating his high school gym teacher that used to terrorize him and shatter his self esteem. Things quickly become more complicated when the hazing starts anew as the gym teacher picks up where he left off...In short, the acting is pretty good (though nothing great), while the plot and the dialogues are average and below average.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers and the poor choice of lines and weak plot.In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here... 2.4 Stars
__label__1 What kind of humour do you like?: If you are the type to laugh if another person gets a ball in their privates, you may like this movie.After Scott's 20th humiliation I couldn't bare seeing more. I was expecting some equal kind of comic battle between the two characters (like Scott getting equal with Thornton - doesn't happen), instead Scott is humiliated throughout the movie. Also that the unsympathetic character played by Thornton always comes out as the smug one is very disturbing.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!: DO NOT BUY THIS TV! I BOUGHT THIS MODEL SIX MONTHS AGO, AND IT HAS BEEN IN THE REPAIR SHOP FOR FOUR OUT OF THE SIX MONTHS!! THE LIGHT ENGINE HAS BURNED OUT TWICE, AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE/SUPPORT AT RCA IS ATROCIOUS!! ANY TIME YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE, YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO WAIT OVER AN HOUR TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THE STATUS OF YOUR REPAIR OR WHEN PARTS MIGHT ARRIVE AT YOUR LOCAL REPAIR SHOP.IN FACT, AFTER DEALING WITH RCA'S CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER, I WOULD RECOMMEND NEVER TO BUY RCA PERIOD. THEY REFUSE TO DO ANY EXCHANGES THROUGH ANY OF THEIR DEALERS, AND THEY HAVE PROMISED TWICE TO EXCHANGE DIRECT FROM THE WAREHOUSE, ONLY TO GO BACK ON THEIR PROMISE TO SAY THEY'VE "FOUND THE PART I NEED", ONLY TO SHIP THE WRONG PART TO THE LOCAL REPAIR CENTER, AND THEN MAKE EXCUSES AND SAY ANOTHER ONE IS ON THE WAY. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE NOW, AND MY TV IS STILL BEING REPAIRED WITH NO END IN SIGHT. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!!
__label__2 The Beatles' Long & Winding Road: As a hard-core, inveterate Beatles' fan, I loved this collection. It is true that the narrator has the enthusiasm of a dead horse, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this collection.Viewers will be treated to some bonus footage of the Beatles in newsclips and interviews. No songs are included in this collection. It is power-packed with information and, if you can overlook the tiring drone of the narrator you will certainly have much to cheer about this collection.For those who are determined to travel down the Long & Winding Road from start to finish (although you may want to watch this in installments), you will get a lot of good Beatle exposure and information as the boys shot to fame in Liverpool, to their famous August 29, 1966 swan song concert in San Francisco.
__label__1 Very bad film, do not waste your time: This film had poor video quality, horrible acting, an extremely weak story-line and it was directed poorly. I understand that independent films do not have the budget or production values of industry-funded movies, but even by indie film standards - this movie was horrible. I regret spending $1.99 to watch this. Even at an amateur level, the videography and acting are below standard. The scenes are so badly done that I found myself chuckling during serious scenes. I would not recommend that anyone watch this film.
__label__2 A bit pricey but cute: You can find cheaper hats at Target....but this hat is cute cute cute. If you have the extra cash lying around. Downside: it doesn't have a strap to keep it attached to the baby.
__label__2 Adorable.: I bought this hat for my 3 month old who was quickly outgrowing all of his infant hats. Not only is this one cute and well made, it stays on his noggin. Other hats seem to work their way off during the course of the day, or migrate forward and cover his eyes. The material is soft and cozy, and we love that it isn't made in China.
__label__2 I LOVE THIS HAT!!!: This hat didn't fit my son until he was 3 months (75% for head size) He looks like a real stud in it and gets nothing but compliments. I love the color it goes well with many of his outfits. He is now 5 months (still 75%) and the hat is getting tight and short. Other have mentioned folding the rim down to make it fit longer... I think this makes the hat look weird and disproportioned. I do wish the ears were more forward; the ears are centered on the hat, so when wearing it they are back by the crown of his head. it would look cuter to have them more towards his temples to so could see them when looking directly at him. Though you can still see them I think this would improve the look. Overall great product!
__label__2 Amazing: Charlie Christian is Incredible.this is Why History is so Important to Go&Discover a Great Talent such as This Man.He will Blow your Mind along the Lines of Robert Johnson.
__label__2 Terrific First Novel: Keith Scribner has written both a psychological drama and a suspense thriller in his first novel. The Goodlife, based on an actual event, begins with the kidnapping of a chemical company executive and follows the crime over a three day period. The plot unfolds through the points of view of the five main characters, moving the story forward, from different directions, to it's completion. This is a very complex, yet readable, compelling story. The writing is gritty, riveting and true to life and Mr. Scribner has a real talent for dialogue. The characters are painstakingly drawn and developed and the scenes so vivid they almost jump off the page. A tight, suspenseful, fast-paced page turner. Keith Scribner doesn't disappoint.
__label__1 Pretty pictures, poor directions: Despite the very nice photos by Mr. Brooks and Mr. Cook, some of the directions can be a bit misleading. After following the directions from this book to Kings Creek Falls, I became considerably disoriented and only found the falls after consulting with other directions from online sources. Mark Morrison's Carolina guide has much better directions, though less photographs. Online researching will also provide many, many more than the 27 Falls located in "The Waterfalls of South Carolina." Check on Allen Easler's website or the Greenville Online Outdoors for more falls and, hopefully, better directions. If you just want to look at the pictures, though, this is a nice little paperback.
__label__2 Great Value; Easy To Use: I purchased this scanner for the sole purpose of transferring old slides to a digital format. After more than a hundred scans, I have to say this is a wonderful item. It is easy to use; the software is simple. Though I have no comparison scans, the image resolution exceeds expectations (I scanned them at 1600 x 1200).A professional photographer might prefer a better model, but for home scanning and transferring personal pictures, the Canon 4400F is a great value!My family and I enjoyed seeing full-sized pictures for the first time in decades.
__label__2 Worth it for home use: I recently purchased a new computer that came with, of course, windows vista. Unfortunately, my old canoscan 1220 scanner was not compatible with this operating system so I started looking for a new one. I really liked the old one so I stuck with Canon and got the 4400. It's faster than the 1220, but is a bit bulkier, and requires its own power outlet (the 1220 was powered thru the USB). Good scanner, but if I could have kept my 1220 I would have.
__label__2 Canon scanner: For the money, it seems to do a very good job on photo reproduction as well as text. A bit noisy, but easy to operate.
__label__2 Great Scanner: This scanner for the price is great. It does exactly what I need for my type of work.This is the second Cannon product I have owned. Was not happy with my HP maybe it's time to change?
__label__2 Great little scanner: This is a nice little scanner. It is small, scans nicely, easy to install and use... I have Vista, and it wasn't really any problem to install the software. i can't speak about the software b/c I don't use it much (I import into Photoshop), but it looks pretty simple to use. The push buttons are a breeze to use. I use this for my small business as my primary scanner and it works nicely. Good value overall...
__label__2 Canon Scanner: Good scanner with excellent resolution. Software is not "user friendly"; too complex. Top of unit is curved and if desk space is an issue, it wont support any thing on top of the unit. Negative and slide scanning a plus.
__label__1 Canon CanoScan 4400fFColor Image Scanner (1306B002): I'm a little disappointed in the Canon Scanner because I thought the advance in tecnoledge would have produced a better, more advance product. The white cover used to scan photos is a flimsy piece of cardboard, which Im sure will bend,ware out, or crease some place. More frustrating is trying to put the flimsy piece back on.
__label__2 Great: Everything as promised. Really easy to operate, great quality of documents and pictures after scanning. The scanner itself is very light and not bulky at all.
__label__2 Does what's supposed to do, well: The results of the scans for all media (negatives, slides, photos, paper) are very good. The software user interface is a bit clumsy, though. I'm sure Canon can afford to spend a bit more to get software to match the hardware.
__label__1 This tv is terrible: The dvd player hasn't worked since the first 2 months I had it. It constantly has to be unplugged and reset due to blue screen.
__label__1 Extremely bad: Please do not buy this video. It contains a very bad quality course of japanese including poor and old images. Japanese simbols on screen are almost impossible to read. If you buy it, you will loose your money.
__label__1 Returned twice: Ordered 4 chairs...sat on them once...and 2 broke immediately. They were replaced and I am softly sitting on them and not letting anyone over aprox. 100 lbs or so to sit on them. If another breaks I will try to return them all for a refund.
__label__2 Completely engaging, original, pull-you-along fiction.: I can't believe I let this book sit in my "to be read" pile for two years. I was sucked into the story right away. I don't know anything about painting or the Dutch, but this book is fantastic! Very funny and wonderfully detailed. I am SO intrigued by the author's mixing of fact and fiction. Time to do some sleuthing of my own on the internet...
__label__2 Used but functional.: I purchased a used Dual XDM7510 In Dash CD/MP3/WMA Receiver from Crader Electronics & p.c. repair. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it took a bit longer to arrive than the estimated shipping date and all the old solder-less crimp style connectors were left on. I purchased this specific unit to replace the same style unit that quit working and the used one works just fine after installation. It arrived clean and in good shape.
__label__2 FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: We use ours very heavily!!!!! Ours is used for our Ebay sales, and sometimes is on and being used all day long. It is one incredible machine!!!!Far better than it's same priced competitors, it comes with incredible software from Newsoft Vista Scan with the scanner interface of Presto Image Folio. It is the simplest and best scanner software I have seen. It eliminates the 47 steps that is associated with Adobe software.Buy it now!!!!!John
__label__2 A great idea, wonderfully executed.: I bought this album being a huge Metheny fan and it certainly lived up to my expectations. To be very honest, I was expecting something a little bit different, more in line with the stuff that Metheny plays with his group and so it took me a little time to appreciate its true beauty. But, over the last 2 weeks, the album has really grown on me. "Nascente" and "Sometimes I See" are just superb, wonderfully arranged, and with great solos. Metheny's note choice, on the whole, is exquisite as usual and so is Brecker's and Hancock's. James Taylor also sings wonderfully on his two appearances lending a distinct charm to the album. I would highly recommend this work to everyone.
__label__2 Lullaby: I put this CD on one evening and lay down to listen. Between sleep and awake, it played while the curtains billowed as an ocean breeze came through the window. It was perfect.That memory will always define my assessment of this CD-a great lullaby.
__label__1 Skip the beauty, give me pretty: There is SO much potential in the lineup of this CD: the singular talents of the instrumentalists, the subtle and complex simplicity of the tunes, the proven chemistry of the musicians- well documented from numerous beautiful collaborations past, the history alone that these artists have been steeped in; but pretty is the password of the day here.Romantic sounds for a candlelit dinner. Numerous candidates for any "best makeout tunes of all time" compilations. Even James Taylor's blessings to validate the safety factor of this project. Nearness of You has all this, and less.Missing are fresh meaningful readings of the (beautiful) compositions, any hint of lyric urgency or that sense of voice that makes a jazz ballad sing. Now I know that Michael, Pat, Herbie, Charlie and Jack have paid their dues and have proven they're beautiful artists. Just don't look to The Ballad Book as evidence. You should buy this knowing the music is pretty and money is beautiful.
__label__1 don't waste your money: do not waste your money on this. it has the graphics of a gameboy advance. buy a real game like halo or jedi academy
__label__2 Love in the Midst of War.: I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased every book that I could find written by the author; this is one of my favorite books by the author. The book has an extremely well written storyline and I greatly enjoyed reading about the interaction between each of the major and minor characters. I have never enjoyed reading about the American Civil War, however, the author was able to capture my attention in this book. I highly recommend this novel; even-though it is a fictional account of the American Civil War, it is an exceptional account of the interaction between two men from opposite sides finding happiness together.
__label__1 Total Rubbish: I should have known better. Although it's said you can't tell a book by its cover...in the case of "The Low Road", I should have trusted my better instincts. The cover is a dead give-away. I love period fiction and I enjoy gay literature, but this book is neither. It's nothing more than the gay equivalent of a smutty bodice ripper -- all longing and panting. It was all I could do to get through the first chapter before tossing this ridiculous book into the recycle bin.
__label__1 Don't waste your money here: This book is proof positive that the English are not entrepreneurs. The book is very short with large typeset and poorly drawn illustrations conveying next to nothing.
__label__2 GPS Software: It shipped quickly and got there when expected. The problem is that the softwares manual is not very user friendly and can be confusing for 1st time users.
__label__1 Are you kidding me?: I honestly do not know what Topo US is good for. I have hunted for hiking trails but haven't found any in my area... or any area for that matter. I have found pipelines and powerlines... whooptie do...Also, I use my Garmin for road navigation... I assumed that TOPO would overlay street maps... WRONG... There are like a million little TOPO maps and I have to go into map setup and individually enable/disable the maps... a major pain when scrolling through 50-200 maps. The TOPO has streets but then are WAY out of date. like 20 years out of date. and you HAVE to look at the old roads when looking at TOPO data.Some friends had me do some searches on underwater wrecks for deep sea diving but they didn't come up... I honestly don't know what this software is good for.2 Stars instead of one because there ARE topolines and mountian peaks.
__label__2 Terrific young adult book: Under a Bear Moon is a wonderful paranormal tale. On first glance you might expect a wearbear story to be all gruesome and blood and guts, but nothing could be further from the truth with this book. Carrie Masek has put together a sweet love story between two teenagers, one of whom has a bit of a problem with being out after dark. The story is well-crafted, showing the blossoming love between Greg and Lynda as well as the difficulties of falling in love with someone who is ...well, different. I recommend it highly for anyone who enjoys romance, and especially as a gift to a teenage girl.
__label__1 another great Serie from the 80s: This is another great series from the 80s but its a BIG BIG BIG shame that Warner Brothers cancled again a DVD release. And I don't understand it. I really would love to buy the whole serie on DVD.Sadly I'm from Switzerland and can't watching it online through amazon-video.Common WB, give us Fan's a chance!!!!!
__label__2 please hurry up: It's half way through 2012 and still no falcon crest season 3. I could be dead before I see this wonderful series again
__label__1 Dense essays about man's 20th century blahs: There are very few books that I have been unable to finish because of ennui, but this was one of them. I made it about 2/3 of the way through and had to call it quits. This book badly needs editing. Percy asks some engaging questions to begin the book, but it is all downhill from there.
__label__1 Should not be listed in this category: These are short pieces of movies about Glen Gould not paino music performences. You don't see any real Glen Gould playing piano in this DVD. In that regard I am dissapointed or I might have been misled to think these are some documentary films about Glen Gould. Actor Colm Feore's performences in #6 Hamburg and #9 LA Concert are two of the interesting pieces to see. But in my opinon this DVD should not be listed in the Musucal and Performing Arts category where most people buy DVD's are ofter watch the performences again and over again such as Glen Gould's Goldburg Variations. I centaily will not watch this DVD again.
__label__2 quite interesting: It gave the dinosaurs a mind and a story. It was humorus at times. It was intertaining. The animation was well done.
__label__2 Vanessa's greatest.The most talented Miss America ever: I didn't pay attention to Vanessa Williams records played on the radio untill I heard "Dreaming" in the late 80's. I was amazed at her beutifull,sweet voice."Save the best for last," and"The Sweetest Days" are my favorites also.I still have to laugh when I hear "Colors of the Wind" played on the radio.I remember when Vanessa sang this song on the Oscars,and when she was done,Whoopi Golberg said,"I always wanted to know what color my wind is."
__label__1 Single layer release in America!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: While the European PAl format release is a DVD-9, i.e. a DOUBLE LAYER with 8.5 Gb of video and audio data, they used a DVD-5 i.e. a SINGLE LAYER disc for the NTSC release in America.This means video has been recompressed and a lot of quality was lost.I have not seen the PAL release, but I can assume the quality is so much better.The music is excellent, and the sound quality is very good despite the use of Dolby Digital instead of LPCM (CD quality) for the audio tracks.
__label__1 Could have been 4 stars........: The first DVD that I received had a momentary pause and then something flashed on the screen for a moment. This appeared on any DVD player, apparently some sort of a defect when putting the production together. Amazon replaced the disk without a problem but the replacement DVD predictably did the same. I don't have the patience to keep returning the thing until the error is corrected. That's a shame because the concert was different than most others, a nice mix of Anderson's lighter music and classics, and quite enjoyable. I would have rated this a 4 if I could get a DVD that wasn't flawed.
__label__2 an awesome experience: This dvd is awesome! I'm in awe of Ian Anderson and have been since the 70's but this took my enchantment to another level withthe classical part incorporated into the rock. I thought it was well edited and included shots of the whole band. I really gota kick out of the expressions on the orchestra's faces and how they were enjoying their experience as well. If you're a fan ofJethro Tull, this will round out your collection.
__label__2 a great book froma great author: Hey all, Harlan Ellison will be at The Booksmith in San Francisco for areading & booksigning on September 15th at 6:30 pmThe Booksmith has set up a special Ellison page highlighting the new andout-of-print books and spoken word recordings available by Ellison. Thepage is located at http://www.booksmith.com/cosmikdebris/ellison.htm
__label__2 Love It!: Well, you just cannot go wrong with anything Psych - I just love these characters - They remind me of me and my friends when we were younger.
__label__1 Ordinary stories - makes audience bored and silly: This is one of the most flopped Psych seasons/series, ever.I was, and still a big fan of Shawn and Gus - but there are few stories in this season which make audience ridiculously bored and silly. Few of such are: "The Amazing Psych Man & Tap-Man", "Dead Man's Curveball", "Indiana Shawn And The Temple Of...", "Let's Doo-Wap it Again", " Autopsy Turvy", and many more.Compared to earlier seasons, in this season both Shawn and Gus are less-funny-more-silly, forget about being 'interesting' characters.Thus, before buying it, borrow it from the local library, watch the episode then go for purchase - because Amazon still sells such an ordinary, Non-Bluray season with pretty high price($40) !!!Real value of such ordinary season should be around $10
__label__1 Love the show HATE the download!: If you have the choice of waiting for the DVD's to be released, WAIT. The downloads are glitchy and frustrating to watch ( I have access to all levels of computers and had ALL of them do this from Mac's to Dells, toshiba and asus) Very unhappy. Love the show and mad that I can't easily watch the season I need to , to catch up with the series.
__label__2 Awesome: This show never fails to make me laugh! Always can identify with the 90's reference quips! We Absolutely LOVE it!!!
__label__2 Great: If you have the rest of the series, you won't want to miss out on this one. I can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD.
__label__2 Great fun for the whole family!: If you're looking for a fun show that everyone in the family can enjoy, this is it. You don't have to worry about off-color humor, profanity, scary scenes, nudity, sex, drugs, or anything else distasteful you might not want the little ones exposed to. Shows like this are a rarity these days!
__label__2 Still great: While not as funny as some of the previous seasons, Psych still makes us laugh every time. Shawn and Gus are great together, and the back-and-forth between the characters delivers, even if the plots don't tickle your funnybone.I know some people didn't like it, but the "Hangover"-themed episode made us laugh till our sides hurt.
__label__1 Don't buy it!: I agree with John Bellis. Very strange and unintuitive interface. Maps not at all up to date. Customer support nonexistent (wait up to an hour and then asked if want to spend ... dollars for support). Delorme makes Microsoft seem bland when it comes to sucking more money out of users for upgrades. You might note that they are not continuing this particular software (Road Warrior) I wonder why?! Also, you can use their software with other GPS units but not their unit with other software. The people who are giving favorable reviews must work for Delorme.
__label__2 Great product but buy it SOMEWHERE ELSE: I agree with all the recommendations but DO NOT BUY IT ON AMAZON. I got it from Home Depot (same 3 bags, 60 days each, same weight/dimensions) but it is only $7.89 at Home Depot (plus no $14 for shipping) if you have a Home Depot give them a call before blowing an extra 36 bucks on this! but DO buy it. they really work!
__label__2 Easy Installation: Scanner was very easy to install and use for the first time. I am very pleased with it.
__label__1 don t buy this!: can lide 70 was much easier to use, software wise.this program is so freakin over complicated.....its not menat for the busy person who needs hours to figure out its filing system. the 70 was much much better. we wasted our money on this piece of crap
__label__2 It's great!: I bought it based on other Amazon reviews and the price. I figured for the price, if it is mediocre then so be it. But, actually, I'm quite happy with its performance and quality. I specifically wanted it to scan in an extensive photo library as a way of fulfilling a New Year's resolution to finally organize all those years' of pictures. It is serving this purpose quite well.
__label__1 Avoid at all costs: I bought two for 30 bucks each, but I think they cost less than a dollar to make. I've already exchanged the first pair I had, and the new ones are just as bad or worse. Here are the defects I've experienced so far:- The part where the microphone holder screws on has come loose and rotates freely. This is one of the first two that I exchanged.- All of the adjustment knobs are different, and none of them are easy to use. Some get in the way of each other when you're trying to secure it!- It's impossible to secure the rotation on the second pair I got. The first were fine. I'm guessing this is another artifact of cheap manufacturing.- All of the adjustments are either loose or very tight to rotate. Some of them go from loose to stuck in just a few degrees of rotation.- There are many more defects, but I'm getting angry just writing about this, recalling my futile attempts to get these set up.Summary: Avoid at all costs! You're better off using duct tape and a broomstick.
__label__2 A Walk Down Memory Lane: I was watching a U tube video about Linda Ronstadt, and wondered if I could get a CD of hers. I went to my favorite site, Amazon, and typed it in. Up popped all her old records, now on CD. I had gotten rid of my record collection years ago, because we live in an RV now and don't have the room. I was excited about finding a collection of her best hits. I didn't need all 8 records again, just my favorite ones. They were all here on this one long playing CD!! Life is good, when you can put on a CD and relive those 60s, 70s and your youth!! Now, I want to find the Monkees. Oh joy!
__label__2 Great Cooking System: It is very easy to assemble, works great even under windy condition. Make sure you also purchase the cover to protect it from rusting.
__label__2 Great burner: This burner is built with very good quality. Easy to set up and very sturdy. I use it in Garage so no problem with the low flame, It's about 0 - 100 % adjustable. The heat is much stronger then the oven in kitchen great for any kind cooking. Very happy.
__label__2 Indispensable: If I lose power, I can still cook! I gave one to my sister, too and they like it, too!
__label__2 Camp Cbef Explorer 2: Ordered just in time to use for a large gathering in conjunction with my wife's 50th birthday celebration, with approximately 40 friends and family in attendance. Using two large 20 qrt stock pots and a cast iron skillet, cooked a large batch of shrimp and grits with the Camp Chef. For starters, it took me no more than a few minutues to set it up and then I was cooking. Loved it. Set up, ease of use, results all fantastic. Can't wait to use it for future large gatherings. Very sold and sturdy. I can tell it will serve me well for years to come.
__label__2 Good steady pace: This workout does incorporate some cardio segments, which are not too complicated choreography wise, but the main focus is the upper and lower body workout. The compound movements (e.g., dips from the step with biceps, leg presses with delts) are challenging without making you anaerobic. The length (50 minutes) is good for a mid-week workout. Is it the most challenging weight workout? No, for those, get the Jari Love DVDs. But is it a good weight workout for the intermediate to advanced exerciser? Yes, if you're happy not being sore the next day. Stephanie is a good cuer and leader; her voice is well modulated, and not too peppy. You will need an incline box (I would recommend the transfirmer over the incline box), and 5-12 pound dumbbells. Why not 5 stars? The ab work. As in the other Firm workouts that do the ab work on the incline, unless you have a death grip on the step, you will slide down. This makes them very awkward to do, even with a mat on the incline.
__label__1 Really needed a ghost writer: Too much back story, too much opinining, not enough story. I got the part about how much the author believed in the mission, but that became too repetitive. So did the part about how evil Saddam and his henchmen were. I was an interrogator in Iraq. I know the back story. I know about Saddam. I wanted to read this author's story, but the writing quality just isn't there.
__label__2 this cd is GREAT!!!!!: anyone who wants to be cheered up fast should get this cd. it's the most uplifting cd ever! if you like this one, try all the other hanson cds. you will not be disappointed! also, if you want something a tiny bit less "poppy" try the moffatts.
__label__1 Too Heavy to Ship or Carry: Bought this behemoth for a daughter going to study in Spain. Took a bit to receive, then, realized it is so heavy that it cannot be shipped to Spain reasonably (it would cost as much as I bought it for). One might think they would advise purchasers about this in advance (since they proclaim themselves to be the overseas adapter experts). It sits in its original unopened box in my garage & I will sell to anyone wanting it for $10... maybe $8.
__label__2 Interesting: The book was pretty good as I recall (it was a while back when I read the book). If I remember right, the book seemed liked it ended TOO abruptly (Mazer left 'ya hanging). But after searching on Amazon I see why: There's a Sequel. It was A good book overall.P.s. If I recall corectly, There was some mild profanity in it.
__label__1 Incorrect Fit: Bought this item readily after the amazon website confirmed its the right fit for my vehicle. When it arrived, I opened the package only to realize that it had a male connector. The one in my car (the faulty one) has a female connector. Please be mindful of this while ordering.
__label__1 Shallow Water: This is a grossly dishonest work dealing with the historical Jesus. Herzog fails to credibly deal with the relevant NT textual matter not to mention addressing and genuinely interacting with scholarship that finds much more to the historical Jesus than Herzog's unplatable academic gruel indicates. He has very little to say about very much; one can thus wade through the shallow waters of Herzog's Prophet and Teacher never getting one's feet wet.Try the following for a good trip through the land of modern historical Jesus scholarship:Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels As Eyewitness TestimonyDale G. "Skip" Wagner, Jr.
__label__2 A Fair Product: This is a good product. I have used this product for one year, and already I'm typing 55 words per minute. I started last year, sixth grade, and I'm typing almost as fast as my mom. This game is really fun because you learn while playing games.
__label__2 FIVE STAR: GREAT, AWARD WINNING BRITISH FILM, PROBABLY WHY IT COST SO MUCH!! SUPERIOR PHOTOGRAPHY, SUPERIOR ACTING.BUT IT WAS SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FROM AMAZON THAN MANY OTHER BRITISH FILMS.
__label__1 Are you serious?: I heard such wonderful things about this movie and was really looking forward to seeing it. I had a couple friends over to watch it and out of the four of us I was the only one left awake to see the end. I was so disappointed. The movie was too long and left me feeling cheated at the end. So gald I didnt buy it. Rent it first before buying...
__label__1 It does not work: DVD would not work in any of my players even the new ones. It came with a little note in it that tells you you need new software to get it to run in most DVD players. I am returning it.
__label__2 Simply the most beautiful movie ever made: This is, by far, the most beautiful movie ever made. E.M. Forster's masterpiece is lovingly brought to the screen by Merchant-Ivory and an impeccable cast. If you somehow fail to fall in love with this film, you have no soul. The writing is superb, sets and scenery divine, and casting dead-on.
__label__1 Terrible BD Transfer: I bought the "Special Edition" BBC Video Blu-ray version that bears the following caveat: "Due to the age and nature of the film, you may notice occasional flaws in the image and sound quality. Wherever possible, we have sought out and restored the original materials to ensure the best possible quality." This is no restored version. The Blu-ray version was no better than a DVD version. I was terribly disappointed. Sony should guard it's Blu-ray reputation!
__label__2 Simply Spiffing! A Dreamy Delight.: The original, quintessential, Merchant-Ivory film. Helena Bonham Carter as the lovely and lost Miss Lucy Honeychurch, on holiday in Florence with her cousin, played by Dame Maggie Smith. With Daniel Day-Lewis at his most uptight, and the only role Julian Sands can be proud of. When I was 16 my best-friend and I would put on our best Victorian threads and eat chocolates while we savored Freddy's hair, Lucy's Temper and "poor Charlotte". Not to mention George.
__label__1 terribly done: shipping was fast, however it was terribly done, the gold tone was not flat and with a lot of bubbles inside, so it make the pin looks very cheap
__label__2 Great buy: I am very happy with yall guys and from my family i would like to say thank you for all your help i will make sure to tell everyone to buy from yall all...
__label__2 This year's downer: I enjoyed this book, but expected more from it than I got. The characters were well developed but seem to sleep walk through the story. There was no real heat between the main characters, they seemed to seek each other out for warmth and comfort not because they truly cared about each other, which is OK, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing. Some of the scenes in the book were brutal, like the West is (was) back then. But the characters seemed to hold back their emotions from everyone, including us.
__label__1 Bogus: I ordered this CD and expected it in a short period of time, per the ad. After three months, I was notified that Amazon could not locate the item, and my order was cancelled. That same day I saw the same item on Amazon, "available for shipping in 1-2 business days" at 5 to 6 times the price when I ordered it.
__label__1 Incorrect information: I bought this atlas several months ago, and loved it. However, I just discovered a major mistake on page 6: Birmingham is listed as the capital of Alabama. (I checked elsewhere to make sure that the capital had not moved from Montgomery.) If this basic information is incorrect, it makes me wonder how many other errors exist, and if I can trust only the information that I know from other sources. Very disappointing!
__label__1 Doesn't seem to do much: I haven't really seen any evidence that using this product actually does anything. My filters still get mildewy and the water, if left sitting for more than a day or two, does the same. I suspect bleach would actually work better and be a much cheaper option.
__label__1 Slow and Unsatisfying: Movie was slow and hard to watch. Not very satisfying. Would have made a better TV show than a full length movie.
__label__1 Put me to sleep: Within 15 minutes I was dozing...looked over and my husband was asleep as well. Very boring - turned it off.
__label__1 Good acting, but very boring!!!: If you're looking for a suspenseful movie, don't look here. The acting is good, but there is no suspense because it's slow character driven drama that is base on murder that doesn't unfolds until the very end of the movie.
__label__1 Slow, Dull: The fact that it's a true story makes it interesting alone - but the plot line, the music, the build us is unfortunately off in a variety of ways. I really wanted to like this movie, but didnt. As a movie, it just falls short. The characters needed a bit more development and the casting was just not as good as it could have been. Kristen Dunst does a good job - but really the movie (and story) is bizarre, so even her acting couldnt pull this movie out.
__label__1 Should have followed by instincts and stopped watching: I usually don't write reviews for Amazon, but this movie was so bad I wanted to try to save others from my misery. 1/3 of the way through, I was really tempted to stop watching, but kept telling myself that it might get better. It never did. I have Amazon Prime so I'm not out any money, but I did waste my time.
__label__1 Unable to care about the characters: While others see Gosling as having done a great job, my own response is that he did, if what he was going for was boring. His character should have been interesting. Instead I found it so boring that it was impossible for me to believe in Dunst's devotion to him. As a result I didn't care about any of the characters. I found the movie long, boring, and disjointed.
__label__1 very good text book: It is a very good text book, but the pictures would be colored. Color pictures are important for the patologist veterinary and for the students.
__label__2 Book of Lilies: I bought this book because I was interested to know about the different kind of lilies. This book has beautiful picture of them.
__label__2 Great Buy: Wonderful buy I got this upon hearing the very sad news about Ronnie James Dio and his death rock and roll will never be the same again, but the seller was great and very fast shipping. I would definetly reccomend this seller
__label__1 Muddled thinking, crass, inelegant style: Reviewed by a woman. I struggled through the first thirty pages, but could not get through the bad writing. He distorts the concept of manhood assuming it to be the most negative and degenerate form of masculinity, and then goes ahead to "deconstruct" it. Man-haters will love it, men searching for the meaning of manhood will waste their time with it.
__label__1 Rubbish!: I am sorry I bought it; what a waste of money and time. Predictable made for television junk. Jane Horricks is a wonderful actor but has chosen poorly the films she has starred in. She would be better off for having passed on this.
__label__1 Read before ordering this CD: As an avid fan of slot and video poker software, I was extremely disappointed with this product. The entire CD ONLY HAD 3 games on it - one video poker machine and two slot machines. No wonder it only took about 30 seconds to install! This CD has more film clips and adds pushing a trip to Vegas, than it has the actual games themselves. Do yourself a favor - do not order this product.
__label__1 C'est Brigitte!: At times I can't really comprehend Brigitte Bardot's fame- she's sexy, yes, and a fairly okay actress, but as a singer, she's just alright. Her music is not essential, but if you are into 1960's French music it's not all that bad. There are some great songs on this disc, not really worth buying the whole album, but still a fun listen.
__label__1 Simply Horrible: If there was 0 star, I would have given 0 star instead of 1 star. This earrings are horrible and 1000 times smaller than what looks in pic. I had bought engagement ring from Amazon and had a great experience so went for this one. But ended up returning this item as soon as I got it. Even for 10 bucks I wouldn't buy these earrings.
__label__1 Got what I paid for: The price was too good to be true. Although the size of the diamonds is accurate, they lack sparkle. My CZ's are prettier. Fortunately, these were for my 17 year old daughter. I didn't to spend a great deal in case she lost one. I wouldn't recommend buying any diamonds that fall this low on the color scale.
__label__1 Horrible.. DO NOT Waste your time: Please don't make the mistake I did by ordering these earrings. I did not read the reviews of other people regarding these as I should have. They do not look at all like real diamonds. They do not sparkle. They honestly look like stones made out of plastic. Although, plastic might shine more than these.They are not worth the money at all!
__label__1 Do not order this item: The quality is simply terrible. They were so cloudy, you almost would have thought they weren't even diamonds. Also, one of the two had a black fleck in it too.
__label__1 Poor color: I expected these earrings to be small but the color and clarity is much worse than I expected. The diamonds look milky white and have not sparkle. I would not spend a dime on this piece.
__label__1 Worst looking diamond I have ever seen: I saw the negative reviews and, despite them, decided to give these a shot. The second I took them out of the package I knew that they were going right back. These are UTTERLY the worst looking diamonds I have ever seen, even for $99. I am not a diamond expert but a diamond should not a have milky white color.The good thing is Amazon makes returns easy...
__label__1 Not good for VGA presentations: We bought this projector for training presentations. We are now in the processes of returning it. The 5 year old projector we have has a more legible text output. I'm not sure what the problem is, from other reviews this projector is great for movies. If you are looking for a VGA presentation projector this is NOT the solution.
__label__1 Very BAD quality: I placed an order to buy these stickers with RED Arabic letters for my white Apple wireless keyboard, but what I received was with WHITE letters so they didn't work. Fortunately, I have a MacBook Pro with black keyboard, so I decided to use them, BUT, each sticker can cover about 75% of each key. As a result, I threw them in the trash.The worst thing that happened after this purchase was when I received and email from Amazon Market Place asking me to rate this order and the seller, so I wrote exactly what I mentioned above, the next day I received an email from the seller who insisted that it was my mistake because I ordered stickers with white letters not red and that I needed them for my PC not for my mac! plus, the way that the seller has wrote their email to me was very rude and I saved their email. Well, I'm writing a review right now on the product that I purchased which indicates that it is with red letters not white.
__label__1 Umax Astra 2000U: The scanner has never scanned since new. I can understand a unit being shipped factory without firmware. Mistakes happen. But the Umax customer service is just plain lousy. The "Get them off the phone" and "don't answer e-mails" policy is an insult. I'll pay a little more and by an office HP.
__label__1 Umax products $ucks!: do not buy umax products... it is a total waste of money.most of the time the drivers and software provided by the company does not work with the operating system you are using. in order for it to work properly you must go to their web site and download a patch that supposed to fix the problem but instead the patch conflicts with other softeware such as camera software or even the operating system (one more thing the drivers and patches at their website are not free).I wrote to umax and they have never responded to any of the emails i have sent to them. I decided to call the support center and I was refered back to the website to download another patch. (very bad customer support)
__label__1 Scanner is very picky: I bought this scanner several years ago and have felt like I wasted my money. It did okay under Windows 98SE, but I had problems getting it to work under Windows 2000 Pro. I had to download the W2K software/drivers (none provided with the original CD), which took forever, of course.To make matters worse, I upgraded my computer last month from a PII 400 to an AMD XP 1800 with an ASUS A7S333 motherboard, 80 GB Maxtor hard drive, and 512 MB Kingston DDR RAM. I kept the same video card, DVD & CDRW drives, etc. I reloaded Windows 2000, loaded the software/drivers, and nothing happened.After trying for a week, I gave up. I tried to find updated drivers on the Umax site, but no, they wanted me to fork over [money]to ship a CD to me. Harrumph.So, it now sits on the floor and acts as a cat perch. That's about all it's worth.
__label__2 Good scanner with decent software package: I've used this scanner for over a year now and find the total package to be quite good. The scanner tends to scan images a bit dark, but that is easily corrected with the included imaging software (I actually use PaintShop Pro to adjust the brightness). The OCR (OmniPage LE)does a fairly good job, but free OCR software will never be the match of $100.00 programs. I scan images almost exclusively for posting to websites. The scans are fairly quick, even with the 30-second warm-up for the first scan. You get quite a bit of bundled software, some of which is redundant (how many graphics programs do you really need?). I use the copy utility much more than I thought I ever would. I even put a shortcut of the Copier on the desktop so I can copy quickly. In short, this is a pretty good scanner with some decent included software and a great USB interface!
__label__2 The Men's House - BRILLIANT!: I am a Master Mason in Southern California who has read & studied countless Masonic writings, tests, and books. Many are hokie, many are incorrect...however, every once in awhile, a great piece of work comes along. "The Men's House" is one of these works. This book was written to be enjoyed & understood by everyone - Masons & non-Masons alike. If you would like a peek into the world that Masons enjoy & wish upon the rest of humanity, this is the one. Very inspirational & thought provoking, this book is a must-read/must-own. CHRIS
__label__2 Memories that last a lifetime: I watched all these videos as a child and they began a lifelong love of natural science for me! They have a way of making science interesting for children. I recommend them!I'm getting all nostalgic now.
__label__1 The 2.5 oval was broken. Im getting really tired of this. There is no need to say any more. Broken.: I have to write 20 words on broken. The rack cant even be used with that dish broken. By the way one of the lids is too small.
__label__2 Save The Shipping and Handling Charges: This is a great product as all corningware is but why buy it from Target and pay almost $20 in shipping and handling when you can buy it direct from Amazon and it qualifies for free super savings shipping?
__label__2 Old School Flavor w/New School Hits: Art Official Intelligence... Who would have thought that De La would have stood so strong? The new album is fresh and innovative with hooks that are off the hook. Various artists that appear on tracks add flavors of R&B as well as old school rap. Thank you Beastie! AOI gives us somthing to think about as well something to dance to. Change of pace. Thanks to De La.
__label__2 I'm partial to this album because I'm a De La head!!!!: I love all of De La's albums... as any Native Tongues junkie would!!! I have all 5 DeLa albums sitting right next to the Tribe, Latifah, and Jungle Brothers collections. Clearly, "3 feet high and rising" is EVERYONE'S favorite De La album... but if you're old school, how can you not like De La? Favorite Tracks on this CD: "Set The Mood", "Thru Ya City", "All Good", and "Copa".
__label__2 REMARKABLE: ABIDE WITH ME is remarkable, just over-the-moon good. This is what real writing and perfect storytelling are all about. Liz Strout definitely has the gift.
__label__2 Spirtitual Inadequacy and Redemption: I really enjoyed Strout's earlier novel, AMY AND ISABELLE, so when this book came out (seven years later!), I was willing to give it a read, sight unseen.ABIDE WITH ME is a testament to Strout's skills. She manages to get an avowed secular humanist (me!) to dive deeply into this portrait of a Congregational minister and father who is in deep mourning for his wife. Feeling that his travails are minor compared to the losses that others throughout history have faced, he starts to lose faith in himself. Eventually, his daughters and congregation also begin to lose their faith in him as well.Although the book deals with inner turmoil, there is a lot of dryly spun New England humor in it as well, a leavening that makes for a very satisfying prose mixture. I just hope that I don't have to wait another seven years for Strout's next gem of a novel.
__label__1 Left Me Cold: It's so fascinating to read reviews by ordinary readers like all of us, not literary reviews. Human nature is so diverse. The latest edition of The New Yorker gave a very favorable review of this book. But for me, I don't know that this was the worst book I've read in the last few months, but it came close. I couldn't have been less interested in the characters, the subject matter, the location - the whole book left me cold. I have read comparisons to Gilead - a wonderful book. Abide with Me is not in the same league, not even playing the same game.
__label__1 Mega Marbles New Generation Marble Set: Not a good choice for our little grandchild as the marbles are too big to use in Quercetti Marble Run with Motorized Elevator. Sad part is it broke that other game on Christmas Day!
__label__2 Tells the Untold Story of the Holocaust: Piotrowski masterfully discusses and documents many topics usually avoided in traditional Holocaust education. These include: the collaboration of Jews with both Nazis and Communists, the murder of 3 million Polish gentiles by the Germans, and the deportation of 1.5 million Polish gentiles to Siberia by the Russians (where most of them died--not in gas chambers, but from disease and starvation). Must read for anyone interested in then FULL account of the Holocaust.
__label__1 Where's the dial indicator?: looked like a nice enough scale, but it had no indicator. After a few quick shakes i heard it rattling around around inside the scale. Thank God for Amazon's easy return policy.
__label__1 Horrible, horrible, horrible...: This has to be one of the worst books ever written. I spent almost $30.00 on this book and felt totally ripped off. Brad Knight speculates on what he felt like happened to Laci, and why Scott did it, etc. I don't care what he "speculates" happened to Laci, I want facts and there wasn't any given in this book. He then goes on to bore us about his take on the O.J. Simpson murder case (as if this has anything to do with the Peterson case-don't ask.) He rambles on and on about his theories on both of these cases, but his theories are based on speculation, rumors, etc. The fact the title of the book is "Laci Peterson: The Whole Story" is a joke...the book ends even before the trial. He is supposedly going to write a second book to finish where the first book ended...boy, that's one book I won't be buying. If you want to read the definitive book on the Laci Peterson murder case read Catherine Crier's great book, "A Deadly Game".
__label__1 Couldn't even finish the book!: I bought this book in hopes that it would offer additional insight into the Laci Peterson case. I paid around $30.00 for this book and couldn't even finish it! The author included all these personal stories about himself, that had nothing to do with the case at all! There were so many stories about himself, that I found myself skipping through the book, just trying to find content about the actual case. I finally said enough, and put it away for good. I let my aunt have it, and she only got through the second chapter. My advice is to save your money.
__label__1 Book was OK, software was not: This book was useful, but the software was a disappointment. the sofware was not very similar to the actual GRE test.
__label__2 Good product!: The other plastic garages and service stations that we have purchased in the past were made so poorly, but this one has really stood the test of time with two kids under the age of five.
__label__1 Not fine jewelry: I was looking for some nice jewelry to give our 14 and 16 year old nieces. This is not it. This will end up as a present for the 10 year old niece because we got it at the Friday sale price of $15. The pendant is smaller than the on-screen picture, smaller even than the fingernail on my ,ittle finger, and the stone is so small it is hard to see.If I had paid the $45 they ask for it regularly I would have been even more disappointed and asked for a refund... evven at only $15 I am tempted to send it back.
__label__1 This show is NOT OKAY!: Its a very violent show that leaves you feeling horrible every time you watch it. The main characters get away with killling, drug dealing...shooting young boys. With all the tragedies in our country, this show is an extremely violent and bad example to the young generation who may be watching. The only proper ending would be for the main characters to get caught by the DEA!
__label__2 Such a great show.: This series is starting out to be as good as the previous that captured my attention. With the removal of Gustavo from the picture the scare element of before is mostly gone but they were able to successfully add to the existing drama that seemed to end in season 4. Good times.
__label__2 Great show.: The good - well written and acted show. Plot twists, real enough.The bad - not one of the characters is a good person. Like, 4 parts bad qualities to 1 part redeeming qualities . This show creates anxiety, which I guess could count as a good just as easy.
__label__2 Great Series: RIVITING ! Next to Dexter this is my favorite program... This certainly beats watching the election campaign and conventions. Hope they make another season.
__label__2 Little sparkling gems!: I just received these earrings, amazingly quickly from Amazon (thank you!) and I really love them. They are tinier than I expected, but they still look beautiful as I prefer small earrings. The sapphires are deep blue, almost black, but they shine in the light, due to their beautiful facets. The diamond in the middle is tiny but it lightens the flower. I'll try to buy the other same earrings with ruby, and emerald.
__label__1 Might Be A Good Product, but...: ...the nozzle arrived obliterated in 10+ pieces. The box was fine so I do not blame UPS. Might have been damaged from the warehouse and shifting destroyed it. Actually it looks like someone took the nozle off, stepped on it, then stuck it in the box. I'm not saying that's what happened, but you get the idea of what it looked like. The nozzle is important on this, so it is now useless. These things happen, I understand, but BEWARE this is not returnable due to being classified as hazardous. I can't see how this could be classified as such, but I did not see it. I guess that is my fault for not reading the whole page. However I have to rate this as an Amazon FAIL. Left a packaging feedback, but no response is promised or likely. I can't find a customer service link to talk to someone about it. I will update my rating if this is resolved, but it doesn't look good right now.
__label__2 Gran colección: Disfruté completamente de este álbum. Aquí están las listas de canciones:1 Te lo Pido2 Teniendote a Ti3 Necesito de Tu Amor4 Mi Casa Chica5 No Lastimes Mas6 Ando Buscando Novia7 Telenovela8 Estoy Loco por Ti9 Perdido en las Copas10 Nomas, Nomas11 Diario de Mi Vida12 Mi Cafetal
__label__2 Breast Cancer Husband's...Get This Book!: You'll need this advice one way or another. There are some topics you may not want to deal with, but trust me, you WILL deal with them. Your wife's cancer diagnosis doesn't come with a manual...this book is a great start. (Even though you wish you weren't reading it...once the dust settles...you'll be thankful for it.)
__label__2 So very helpful: My husband is not a book reader, but he read this book cover to cover. It scared him, but let him know what to expect. He was a wonderful caretaker. This book helped him get ready and know what to do, as well as what "Not" to say! We give it to other couples that have been diagnosed.
__label__2 Price and results - a double threat treatment!: The price of this eye creme is outstanding. Then I tried it and it is THE BEST eye creme I've ever used. I normally spent $40+ on eye treatments and now I don't have to. I will never switch from V'TAE Eye treatment, I am hooked!
__label__2 You're going to want this strategy guide if you want access to the best wanzer in the game.: As usual, nothing about this game is hard enough to warrant a strategy guide, but you're going to want this one if you want to get your hands on the best wanzer in the game, the Hoshun. There are also a lot of other secrets that you might miss if you don't at least have this guide handy.
__label__2 Great movie!: I watched this movie not knowing what to expect, but by the end of this movie, I was in love with it! It is a great story, a little tragic, but still worth the time to watch it.
__label__1 Could of been great: The first seven pages of this book made me believe it would be a real page turner. After that things went amiss. You never really discover what motivated certain main characters to behave the way they did, or why. You also never find out what happened to certain characters, they are just dropped. I also expected a book that involved werewolves throughout, although that too left me disappointed. The worst of it was all the type o's I found. It got to the point where I just wanted to start circleing them out of frustration. I could go on but then I would give away the entire story line and if any one is still interested in reading this book that would be unfair.
__label__2 Not just lycanthropes: Gripping horror is often about the desires, both positive and negative, surrounding the family. Such is the case with Richard Leefs novel, a tale of brotherly competition gone bad illuminated by the supernatural. When a down-on-his-luck photographer accidentally shoots photos of a murder, he becomes the target for supernatural vengeancecor was he the target to begin with? The werewolf is perhaps one of those classic monsters most rich with symbolic possibilities, and Lee employs here an interesting conceit. When horror works, it not only scares us, it illuminates something dark in all of us. We look forward to more from this writer
__label__1 Guilt By Association: I think anyone reading this book will feel that they have been made to feel guilty. To me, more than trying to help with these feelings, the book does more to bring them to your attention and you begin to think - OMG - what am I doing with my kids and I should feel guilty about it !The book is an easy read and does not do much to answer any questions in my opinion. It may make you feel better however, because it says its ok to feel guilty. In the end - the book did little for me.
__label__2 Outstanding book: An outstanding book. I myself knew absolutely nothing about electricity when I first bought this book - although obviously it didn't make me an expert, it nonetheless taught me what I needed to know to start modifying my boat's electrical systems. I admit that I am biased - Don Casey is one of my favorite sailing authors - but if you are a novice and need to upgrade your boat's electrics, this is the book to get.
__label__1 Doesn't work/not worth the money!: I purchased this as a gift and we were excited to start using it right away, however our potatos were a little old and starting to go soft, but we thought why not. Even with softer potatoes this was horrible to use. Took so much effort to push the potato through and the end was never completely cut.Not being ones to give up we cleaned it up (not easy to do by the way) and put it aside until we had new potatos to see if that made a difference. It did not.Trying to line everything up, pushing, etc was difficult. We then tried the smaller blade for smaller fries thinking perhaps it was the blades, but that was even worse.Just a horrible waste of money, ended up returning it.Would not recommend.
__label__1 worst junk ever: Worst piece of Chinese junk I ever purchased.Only fits half of a potatoe and can't even stand up to that.I used it three times and the handle broke, a blade bent and came out and the blade frame cracked. Save your money and leave this one in China.
__label__1 Weekend cook: Sorry but this is a total piece of junk. I guess you really do get what you pay for. Don't waste your money. Spend a little more and get quality.
__label__1 Poor construction quality: I purchased this item after reading the positive reviews here at Amazon.It arrived today and I am pretty disappointed about the poor quality of construction. The box overall is somewhat flimsy and can easily be twisted and bent (it feels like thin leather wrapped over a cardboard body frame).The latch sticks, so it doesn't operate smoothly or easily and the lid doesn't open quite enough to balance properly so it sometimes falls closed by itself.On the plus side, the interior pockets and features are nicely appointed in cushy-soft velvet and the watch holders fit my watches nicely and snugly.I had thought that at this median price the build quality and fit/finish would be better. It is disappointing enough that I will probably buy something else.
__label__2 A Must-have for Wisconsin Winter: I've had Yaktrax before and wore them out after several winters. I use them when shovelling and walking my dogs. These are great on icy roads or sidewalks. I can slip them onto my sneakers or boots (buy a size larger if your boots are heavily insulated with large soles) and no longer 'ice skate' when walking.
__label__2 Great item to survive the winter: I bought these before here in town and loved them. The pair I originally bought still are great. I needed a couple of pair to place strategically at work and in the car in the event of snow and I wasn't ready. Now I'm ready.These Yaktrax are great for those hard to see places. Is is just wet or is is ice? I don't have to worry if I have these on. They provide great grip and give me more confidence when walking.Warning! Don't wear them on tile or hard wood floor, you'll slip and fall! Not to mention possibily damage your floor.
__label__1 Great when they work...: These things work great when they aren't falling off your boots due to the rubber bands breaking. I am a police officer in Alaska and items like these are a necessity due to the weather. However, I was only able to wear these on shift 3 times before the rubber bands broke. I'm quite disappointed in the lack of quality, not the performance. The materials they use are cheap... some rubber and thin metal wire. The unit cost to make these I bet are in the 25-50 cent range and they charge somewhere near $15! I would gladly pay $15 all day long if the product had good durability.
__label__2 Exceptional: I am as good as Consumer Reports but cheaper. These aregreat; convenient, light weight, durable, effective.Not for in-door use; therefore must be put on - where? -in a cold garage? - and taken off in a cold garage (forexample). Which isn't ideal - if the Yaktrax are wet andcold and iced up.BUT. My best friend could have used a pair recentlywhen he was simply fetching mail. Broke his leg inthree places on an icy path.
__label__1 2 months, tops.: The product absolutely works, but you're lucky if you get more than 2 months out of a pair. All they would have to do is solder/weld the wires closed, but instead, they have very strong, lose, sharp wires wrapped around rubber. Also, the product has a tenancy to fall off your shoes midstride at random times.Do not buy.
__label__1 Yaktrax Walker Durability: I was very excited when I first tried on the Yaktrax walkers. I have a very steep driveway. Clearing off snow can get very challenging with slippery winter weather. The Yaktrax walkers worked great the first time. The second time I used them, they also fell off a couple times. The third time I used them the "sturdy outerband" broke. Not sure how they can call it "sturdy" If you plan on using these for anything substantial, I would recommend looking at a different product.
__label__2 safe and secure: In my 20's I had a very serious fall on black ice. Since then, anytime I knew there was going to be icy weather, or anytime there was melted snow that would freeze overnight, I was fearful of going out for anything. I've already used my Yaktrax this year, and I'm no longer afraid. I feel safe and secure and look forward to stepping out. THEY'RE GREAT!!! Thank you!
__label__2 New to winter: Having moved from Florida to upstate NY with no knowledge of winter, the traction cleats have been a life saver. Since I don't always want to wear large snow boots, these cleats make it easy for me to wear more fashionable shoes and still make it to my car in one piece on those cold, icy mornings.
__label__2 These really work: I have problem ankles. My ligaments have been rebuilt by basket-weaving them with a tendon. One of my ankle tendons has been shatter and removed. Stability is vital to my safety. I am amazed on how well yaktrax supplies firm footing. Before using yaktrax, I felt a prisoner of winter; now I am no longer homebound during snow days. I feel free to venture out.
__label__2 Excellent Product: This is an excellent product for anyone who lives where it snows or it's icy. Last year I slipped on our ice in the driveway so I thought I'd give these a try. It's just like walking on dry land. Incredible!! They are easy to put on but definetly take them off in your garage or outside before you walk into your house because they will rip the crap out of your flooring!!
__label__2 No more worries on the snow and ice: After a slip and fall on the ice in the middle of the street in front of a bus, I became terrified of any spot on the ground that appeared wet. I told my doctor about my fall and she suggested Yak Trax. Of course I laughed at the name but went on line and ordered. Tried them out and loved them.
__label__2 Safely Walk On Snow And Ice!: Yaktraxs are lightweight and easily stretch over shoes and boots. They give EXCELLENT tractionon ice or snow. A must for anyone, especially if you live where snow and ice are a commonoccurance. A great product!
__label__2 A Winter Essential in Certain Parts of North America: If you walk on ice, you'll find these very nice. And much less expensive than a broken bone.
__label__1 One month only: These last about a month. Had to get total of six of them for my parents to last through the winter. Guessing this is their profit strategy.
__label__2 Definitely recommend: I ran outside the entire winter with these on my sneakers and they work awesome in the snow and ice. I did go through a pair but with as much as I used them, it was to be expected.
__label__2 Great Safeguard against ice: I only got to use these once before all the snow melted, but now I feel confident that I'm ready for next year. I ride at a local barn and even where paths have been plowed, it's often slippery. I keep the YakTrax with my tack. They are easy to slip on over my riding boots, and I feel secure enough to fetch the horse from the paddock, as well as make trips between my car and the barn. When I am done, I can slip the YakTrax off, rinse them off when I clean my boots, and they are ready for the next use. I had already fallen flat on my back earlier this winter, so it was a great relief to get the YakTrax so promptly after ordering them.
__label__1 Indiferent product; laudable service: Bought the two dvd set. The exercises were a bit softer than what I was looking for; seemed to be aimed at continous gentle movement rather than stretching into and maintaining positions. There did seem to be the advertised several hours of viewing. However the menu navigation did not respond well either to playing on my computer or my dedicated dvd player; gave up trying after a while.Contacted the producer and prompt restitution was made. Five stars for service.
__label__2 Revealing: I knew one woman at work was trash talking about me and the book 'Bully In Sight' suggested there was a co-bully involved. This book helped me understand and identify the co-bully, Middle Bee, and what her function was in the scheme of things. She was someone I thought was a friend, pumping me for information which she fed back to the 'Queen Bee'. It also helped me recognize who the Afraid-to-Bees were and cut them all off. I now understand their ways well enough to go forward and turn them all in to management should they start mis-behaving again..... towards ANY ONE in my organization, not just me.
__label__1 Simply yuck!: It does not taste well. I was expecting real sprouts and better seasoning but it was not simply that great.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: I think Hot Wheels has some great stuff out there....but this is definately NOT one of them. Putting it together is a pain in the neck..it's very hard to click every together and the instructions could not be more unclear. (be aware that the pieces do not come out again, so you're stuck with this large contraption to store afterwards). There is only one function...pull the truck back on the lever and try to hit the monster's chest....so we did....but it was virtually impossible to do. The truck keeps falling in the "pit" and gets eaten every time. It's just poorly designed. It's VERY loud and my intelligent 5-year old stopped playing after 10 minutes.
__label__2 The Running Man (Special Edition): My husband is a great Arnie fan and enjoys any of his movies. This is just another example of another.
__label__2 Varley's best collection.: If you're tired of namby-pamby upbeat SF in "future perfect" tense, this book is for you. I can't believe it is out of print! It should be required reading for any true fan of science fiction. The stories are enthralling; the characters' lives are compelling. You'll lose yourself in Varley's vision.
__label__1 dreadful video playback: Netflix, et al. work great at our home. BUT!!! amazon video sucks. this movie was unwatchable it was such bad video quality.
__label__1 does not last: I bought this "heavy duty UV treated" tarp to cover some equipment that gets Virginia sun two-thirds of the day. Less than a year later it was completely rotted away. I bought a second tarp off Amazon not realizing I was ordering the same one (the "heavy-duty UV treated" sold me again). Same thing happened....it is 9 months later and the tarp is rotting out with holes a couple of feed across. So unless you intent to use this in the shade to protect only from rain, I'd suggest a different brand.
__label__2 bbq grill cover: Well worth the extra money...My grill is like another child to me...only the best best best best best best best
__label__1 Where were the funny parts??: The glowing reviews on the cover made this book sound like a fun read. It wasn't. This book really challenged my attention span, I kept wondering if it was ever going to get better. Summary: Mischevious writer sets up another one to be murdered, just for fun. The hit men, completely unbelievable cultured theatre lovers turn out to be the nicest people in the story. This was the first Martha Grimes I have read and I am in no hurry to try another. I happen to love subtle humor, but this was so subtle I missed it.
__label__1 Arbitrary conclusions; difficult to read: There aren't many books I just don't like, but this was one. Rapaille comes across as an elitist who's tricked everyone into believing he's a guru. I would compare Rapaille to some know-it-all 'expert' at the art gallery who raves about the artist's use of light, color, and internal meaning, only to find out later that the painting was done by an elephant with a brush in its trunk (i.e. waaaay too much meaning assigned to random things). The same is true here. Rapaille's conclusions are ambiguous and unproveable, and you or I could spout the same arbitrary theories. For example, because Americans consume a lot of hamburgers, I hereby declare that the culture code for America is a cow. See? It's easy. This type of random link between unrelated things (and the unsupportable claim that they're not random and they ARE related)is what you get with this book. Rapaille's only genius is in convincing corporate America that he is one.
__label__1 Too short, no elasticity: Title pretty much covers it. They are WAY too short so the wrist/knuckle coverage is minimal, and there is no elasticity so you can't get a tight, secure fit. Don't bother.
__label__2 Aly and AJ, the best!!!!!!!!: Amazing!!!!!!! I haven't even bought the cd yet and I'm addicted to it!!!!! I go on websites to listen to samples of the songs.Ratings-Rush (5/5)No one (4 & 3/4/5)Collapsed (5/5)Something More (5/5)On The Ride (5/5)Speak For Myself (5/5)Out of The Blue (4 & 3/4/5)In a Second (5/5)I Am One Of Them (5/5)Sticks And Stones (5/5)Protecting Me (5/5)Slow Down (5/5)Do You Believe In Magic (4 & 3/4/5)Walking On Sunshine (5/5)That was my review.

__label__2 how did you and your sister start singing together: how did you and your sister aj start singing together what age did you guys start
__label__2 how I envy their composing! Brilliant!: "Wow. Oh my...wow." These are the thoughts that were going through my mind when I first listened to the whole CD of "Into the Rush" by Aly & AJ. It's really cool to think that two girls only a little older than I can really make this kind of music. It's awe inspiring. Honestly. I agree with Eri (Hong Kong), she really summed it up in her review. All I want to add, is that when you listen to this kind of music, it kind of lifts your heart up, raises your spirits, and it just makes you feel like suddenly, so many more things are possible.That probably sounds cheesy, doesn't it? Isn't it weird how something so cheesy, can be so true?? Please, at least listen to this CD. I'm telling the truth when I say that it is awesome!!
__label__1 Pop Doesn't Get Much Worse: What do you expect from a band who's main audience is Radio Disney? For some dome reason this pathetic sister duo decided to promote their music to CCM audience, they even brought on famed producer Ian Eskelin for a few songs. What does it amount to? One of the worst albums of the year. The covers throw rotten eggs at the original versions, and the stench seeps through the rest of the songs. The music is terrible, the songwriting is terrible, their voices aren't anything to write home about, and the lyrics are downright pathetic. Why buy it? Don't, boycott it! What's Christian about this music? What's even good about it? By the way, their new album only expands on the bad parts, it might be so bad, it's burnable.
__label__1 View only with a mega screen with mega sound system: I saw this short short film - years ago at a theatre. At that time this short was a as prelude to a feature length film and it was unique at that time and thus enjoyable. Recently I this film on video on both a regular 27 inch TV and wide screen TV connected to a powerful audio system. If you do not have the wide screen TV and great audio system do not bother. The quality of this film is quite poor compared to the crystal clear clarity of most Claude Lelouch films. Plus it just does not work on the small screen. Bigger the viewing and hearing platform that more enjoyable the viewing. Au Revoir!
__label__1 Trailer......unplugged!: I haul a boat, enclosed utility and a snowmobile trailer and need this adapter for my Chevy Avalanche. Cheaply built and all of my flat 4 prong trailer plugs frequently work themselves loose and disconnect. Amazon offers others for a few dollars more. Pay the difference and get one of the better adapters...unless you enjoy being unplugged.
__label__2 Worked as they should.: One of my sons bought these extra air burst rockets and the other accessories as well. They make for a lot of fun - if you have a larger, open area.
__label__1 The reviews are written by the author?!!: I am merely in the process of conducting a search;but the fact that the author has written the reviews himself (and refers to himself in the third person for one review)causes this marketer to not be interested in what he has to say. How ridiculous! Note: The review requires selecting a rating. I have not actually read the content which may be quite good.
__label__2 Good stuff: It works surprisingly well on my 350z top. It went from gray back to black and it looks like a band new top.
__label__2 The Beautiful Gretchen Mol: This reviewer thought that Gretchen Mol 's performance in THE NOTORIOUS BETTY PAGE in the title role was spirited and breathtaking. The story and script was not over the top and non-exploitive, and it did capture a slice and time of American history/culture (the post WWII America 1950's) when life seemed tame, safe, and somewhat boring? It was nice to see when contemporary America at the time had these slight aberrations of slight deviant behavior simmering underneath the country, questioning decency and morals in society, right before the 60's counter-culture was about to emerge. Overall, a great cast, decent script and cinematography (capturing the look and feel of the 1950's), and the beautiful Gretchen Mol capturing the look and spirit of the queen of the golden age of pin-up girls.
__label__2 keeping your eye on the actor: a charming, stimulating and engrossing film that provides a surprisingly heartwarming take on an extraordinary person. As others have mentioned, the acting is superb. This ultimately satisfying film captures her innocence, her mischief and a vivid snapshot of the indulgences and controversies of the time.
__label__1 Great Read - Mediocre Advice: I purchased this book a little while before going to Paris and read it cover to cover, made maps, reference marks on my maps (basically went over board) believing I had invested money in a guide that was somewhat acurate. Sadly, I was mistaken - many of the stores mentioned were either no longer in business or were at another address. Most of the advice was off the cuff and not honest enough to be taken seriously by anyone. It is a fun read, don't get me wrong, but more as fiction than fact. Paris is a living, breathing animal of a city, always changing - i realize now that advice, not military precision shopping, is what I am looking for, and this is not it.
__label__1 Musica Popular de los Andes is a Bootleg!: This CD is another of the series of bootlegs that came in from Italy in the mid '90s, featuring Yma Sumac. Selling (or buying) it is illegal and it has no business being available on amazon.com. All of Yma Sumac's early material is owned by Capitol Records / EMI and without exception, every legitimate pressing bears their trademark while this one does not. Buy it at your own risk!
__label__2 I Really Enjoyed This Book!: I met Scott Haskins at his Book Reading/signing In Philadelphia a few months ago. He had his Sister do his book reading and you would have thought she was Sasha as she read with so much character and feeling. The Haskins are a very talented family. Anyway, I had to buy this book because she stops reading when Sasha opens the door to the bedroom with surpise then all hell breaks loose. I loved this book because there is a little bit of Sasha in all women. There were times I felt like taking a few of my friend's/family's lovers/husbands out but Sasha had enough nerve to go to the next level. She was about it, bout it! Hey Scott I look forward to seeing you at our Sistahs With A Vision August Barbecue in New Jersey. I have selected this book for my selection in both my reading groups, Busara Nayo is my other group!
__label__2 SASHA'S WAY: This book was a very good book. I couldn't hardly put the book down.Sasha was a killer to her heart even though some of the men did need killing.It would have been good to have a Sasha's two to see if she really did stop killing .
__label__1 SOMETHING DIFFERENT!: I must say this book was very...well...different from what I'm used to reading. And even though this review is late (as in date) I was just able to find it. Since Amamzon was sold out! The cover and the beginning chapter captured my attention, but the story line lacked something...what that is I don't know!
__label__1 Better than live: WEll, the cd is better than their live show. I saw her band in Victoria, B.C. Canada on holiday in 1999 and Michelle Morand's singing was really off key (like scratching down the chalk board off-key). I'm glad the MP3s are better but still I agree with another review that it needs to be polished. I really like the lyrics she wrote, maybe she could write music for other singers! She's got good stories in her songs. I don't think they're together anymore after the cd cause I went to her website and it's old stuff from 1999.
__label__1 Needing polish: While the content within the songs of the album are intelligent, most of the vocal tracks were surprisingly unpolished. It is with wonder that the producer of the album did not take the time to either suggest more work on the vocals, as oftentimes the vocalist is unable to reach a solid note, or to completely redo various tracks to "cover up" the lack of strength and range. A typical album, typical genre of low grade music styling, and just overall typical. Not one of my favourites but everyone wants to be a star, eh?
__label__1 I tried, but couldn't get rid of the odor: I really wanted to love this tea kettle, it is so gorgeous! Unfortunately, like many other reviews stated, it has a bad chemical odor that just wouldn't go away. I washed it, boiled 6 full pots of water, boiled a water/vinegar mix a few times, and even let lemons soak in it.The smell just wouldn't go away. I made some tea and tried to ignore it but I just couldn't get the chemical smell AND taste to dissipate.
__label__1 Returned: I bought this electric kettle and promptly returned it. The water that I boiled had a strange chemical smell (like burning plastic). I tried using vinegar, baking soda, etc. to remove the unpleasant taste, but it didn't work.I purchased a Breville stainless steel electric kettle instead. There aren't any unpleasant tastes with the stainless steel kettle.
__label__1 Good product but always breaks. Cheaply made...: I purchased two of these through a local retailer. The first one broke at the handle where the button is and stopped working altogethe. It would start up and then turn off randomly so it could never complete a heating cycle. It lasted for 6 months to a year. The second one I got as a replacement broke at joint where the lid attaches to the top so it just falls off when pouring (unless you want to hold it in place and burn your hand periodically). Yesterday it started leaking between the black base and bottom of the glass. After hearing reviews of their customer service, I haven't bothered to complain about a replacement. I am looking for an alternative. I liked the product otherwise. It's a shame it's so cheaply or badly made.
__label__1 No significant improvement in awful taste after all these reviews: Unfortunately, like so many other reviewers, I am turned off and very disappointed that Capresso hasn't resolved the problem of the chemical, plastic, whatever is causing the ill-taste of the water after boiling. We don't know if there is any health danger as a result of whatever is causing the ill-taste. The pot is attractive and heats quickly which are great selling features, but the taste doesn't let up after over a year of use. Had considered getting a new one after putting a ding in the glass but have decided against it. I'm done with this product. If the problem gets resolved, I'd purchase it again in a heartbeat!
__label__1 unfortunate smell: Same as others have noted. It's really too bad as the kettle looks and works great otherwise. Even after a vinegar washing and several kettles the smell was still quite strong.
__label__2 Capresso: Sleek, quick, and looks great on the counter or the table. I have received many compliments on it. People (and em) just LOVE IT!
__label__1 poor build quality, still working after 2 years: I bought this in Oct 2009, and most importantly it's still working. I don't have any issues with chemical odor or taste that others have referred to, but there is a light accumulation of rust on the metal heating element.The workmanship quality of the kettle is very low. The handle was broken in the first couple of months, the lid no longer is attached by the hinge, and the power switch is not functioning very well any more. We definitely use it a lot, but I wouldn't call anything we've done to it abuse. So, 2 stars primarily based on the build quality.
__label__1 Stopped working in 9 months: Great wile it worked, this unit is completely dead barely 9 months after purchasing it. Not a very good record next to my regular tea kettle that I have had for 15 years without a problem. I am hoping Amazon will do the right thing and replace it for me; I will update once I find out whether they will.
__label__1 I cannot get rid of the chemical smell!!!: I have used the kettle everyday for a month. I have cleaned it with soap and water repeatedly. The chemical smell and taste are still present.To think I bought this because I thought glass would be "chemically" safer than the plastic kettle I was using. Big mistake. I'm going back to my old kettle.
__label__2 Great: Holy Cow, I'm pleasantly, as in exetremely, pleasedwith this carafe. I use it for tea, my wife uses itfor coffee or whenever she needs hot water in thekitchen. Being able to see the water through the glassbody lets you judge the water temp and turn it offbefore it boils if you don't want water that hot.I highly recommend this item because, as I say....mine works great.
__label__2 Perfect: Perfect kettle. Heats up fast (in about 4 minutes) and shuts off automatically so it doesn't boil over. The kettle is beautiful also.
__label__1 it only lasted 8 months: Our water kettle worked well while it worked, but suddenly broke while heating the water one day. the glass shattered without any trauma or impact and all the water leaked out! Never seen that happen to a water heater before.
__label__2 Extraordinary water kettle: We were given the 259 model Capresso water kettle for Christmas 2011. The kettle is used every single day for making coffee in a drip coffee pot. I was amazed at how quickly the water kettle can bring cold water to boil. IT is really astonishing that water can boil that fast. I have read about the odor and yes we noticed the odor when we first used the kettle, but that subsides with use and after only 2 months we don't detect any odor at all. The design and styling of this kettle is very well done and all around I would give it my highest recommendation.
__label__2 It's Perfect!: Capresso 259.03 H2O Plus Glass Water Kettle, Polished ChromeThis electric kettle is perfect! Visually stunning, AND it works exactly as promised. I've used my first one for nearly a year, at home, and have now purchased a second one for the office. Easy to keep clean and attractive. We use it for both tea and the French press. Cannot think of one single negative to report. I read quite a few Amazon reviews before purchasing, but could not substantiate any of the negatives mentioned by a few people. The only caveat is to WATCH for the sale price!
__label__2 Love Capresso Glass Water Kettle: This is fantastic kettle - no elements to corrode, quick to heat, doesn't take up much room on the counter.
__label__2 magic pink stuff *smile*: My daughter calls Glyco-Thymoline, the "magic pink stuff". :o) It heals sore throats in just a few hours after gargling. It is amazingly wonderful. :o) :o)
__label__2 An excellent guide for beginners: This book provides very useful insights into planking a model ship from a kit. The book is better organized than many books on model ship building, but does not cover complete construction from start to finish, instead pinpointing specific areas of difficulty you are likely to encounter with a variety of models and kits. The book has several lists of tools and equipment for establishing beginner, intermediate, and advanced workspaces and also provides directions for designing several specialty tools that are quite useful. The illustrations throughout are very detailed.
__label__2 Just Love It!: I purchased a lamp exacty like this from a local store about 5 years ago. I used it in my office. A few months ago my husband decided the floor lamp in the mudroom outside his "newly remodeled mancave" was no longer suitable so I offered up my Accord Floor Lamp--of course he accepted. I have been searching all over for a second one for my office--imagine my surprise to find it on Amazon. I really love this lamp because it doesn't take up much space, it's a perfect height next to my desk, each lamp swivals and it has two levels of brightness. Plus it's sturdy enough to stand without toppling when the cat leaps across the room and hits it but it's light enough for me to pickup and move.I'm considering replacing the guest bedroom floor lamp with one of these.
__label__2 Cut Quality Rivals Forrest Chopmaster: I have had this blade installed on my Bosch GCM12SD for about a month and am very happy with it. My previous blade was the Forrest Chopmaster, which is out being sharpened. The Chopmaster is an excellent blade but it's typically $30-$40 more expensive than this Freud. The quality of the cuts I get from this Freud is essentially the same as I got from the Forrest blade when it was new (and sharp). The sawn face of the wood is very smooth -- almost polished-looking -- and requires minimal sanding. If I didn't already own the Forrest blade, I would order a second Freud to have on hand when this one needs to be sharpened! Great blade at a great price.
__label__2 Nice to see some spirituality: Was wonderful to see the characters depend on spirituality for a foundation in life. It clearly illustrated the conflict, the decisions and the conclusions. The thoughts of the characters made it easier for the reader to relate to a sadly popular occurance between couples. The relationship between the children and their spirituality was also evident when the idea of religon was introduced during a time of crisis. All the while, encouraging a family unit as well as independent growth.The plot was intriguing and kept the reader guessing as to which one was the main topic. Definately a summer read!The only way to improve this book would be to offer a little bit more history about the supporting characters. Although it may not contribute to the plot, it would help give a more rounded picture of the group of friends. This may help other use this book as an example of a support group and may provide a shimmer of guidance and hope to those in such a situation.
__label__1 not the best episode: The world adventure teams Dora with Swiper--that's right, as friends. Their mission is to save "Friendship Day" by replacing the bracelets that Swiper had swiped. It is really sad that on a trip around the world they didn't visit ANY country where Spanish is spoken. And what's more, the plot is really boring. Nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid. The songs that Swiper and Dora sing together are LOUSY. Nothing about the songs is catchy or fun.Another odd thing is that Dora's voice is different. It sounds like they couldn't get the same actress they normally use to do Dora's voice. Dora sounds older.There are a lot of fun Dora videos out there but this isn't one of them.
__label__1 NKJV Study Bible: I placed my order January 20,2013 here it`s February 21,2013 and I HAVEN`T yet receive my bible. It was a gift and IM STILL waiting on a arrival day.I placed an order January 20,2013, here it February 21,2013 and I Haven`t receive my bible yet. It been a month. So Im not happy at all.
__label__1 Loved it until it failed after only 6 weeks: This air pillow provides an adjustable amount of support, and was very comfortable under my back all night. I used it while sleeping, and loved it when I first bought it. But, here we are 6 weeks later, and the pillow is leaking air at an increasing rate. The nozzle looks fine, so maybe it leaks along a seam. I'm extra bummed, because it is made in USA, and I always expect good quality from us. Today I bought the OPTP Pillow which is also made by McKenzie. Costs twice as much, so maybe it is better made. Got my fingers crossed!
__label__2 Great Adjustable Lumbar Support: This little blow up lumbar support is perfect for travel. I use it in my car and on planes. It blows up very easily to whatever size you want. Then, when you're done with it, it deflates completely flat, so it will fit into any bag, no matter how full the bag is. The first one I got had a small air leak, but it was replaced by the company.
__label__2 The best adhesive: Love this stuff. Keeps your lashes on all day and night. Easy application Bc it gets tacky after a while. Easy to take off with warm water.
__label__2 Really Nice: Shipped fast and works well. My Mom is 5'2" and on the shortest setting it fits her well. The only thing is every couple of months the screws start coming loose so when you get it stop off at the auto parts store and ask for some lock tight. Just a dab on the screw and it helps keep them in place!
__label__1 Nearly DOA: I have two of model 25404RE3. Needed a 3rd for home office use. Ordered this 'new' model by mistake. The two 25404RE3 phones work fine, but the new 25414RE3 doesn't. First, the phone recognizes only line one when a two line cord is plugged into the first jack. To get it to work for my two lines, I have to plug it into the second jack and use line 3 and 4. Second, it doesn't intercom at all with the 254o4RE3 models. This needs to go back!Also, FWIW I like the aesthtics of the older model better; sleeker looking buttons and less use of dark colors.
__label__1 Disappointing: The product performs as desired save for one huge flaw. There is a coil inside that vibrates with the side of the case and circuit board. Using the supplied solid mounts, this means you hear alot of annoying vibration. The unit is not very substantial in feel. Unless you have your music cranked all the time, or have a very noisy vehicle, you will have a constant annoying rattle.
__label__1 GPS for Mariners: This was a most disappointing book. It was not at all helpful and basically a waste of money.
__label__2 Excellent reference for traditional sailors: Execllent overview of functional and decorative marlinspike seamanship; and clearly written by a real sailorman! Not very deep in any individual area, but highly useful to the novice. I actually made a few items using the instructions, they worked
__label__1 Fantastic song! Too bad they messed up the CD single.: This is one of Enigma's best songs in recent history. The album version has an infectious groove that will make you want to move to it. The only problem? I haven't had a chance to listen to the CD single yet.Unfortunately, the CD-single contains the "copy-controlling" technology that can cause problems with certain car CD players (mine is one of them) and if you want to listen to this CD on a computer (while at work, for example) you are required to install some kind of player software first.Since I am not allowed to install software on the PCs at work, I am unable to listen to this CD in the car or at my office, two places that I enjoy listening to music to. Because of this restriction, and the fact that it has prohibited me from listening to the music that I have purchased, the rating is 1 star (the music may very well be 5-star worthy, but if I can't listen to it, then I can't rate it :-/ )
__label__2 Cool Watch and good quality: I bought this watch for 59$ it's very nice; a perfect size for a woman. Fluorescent handles leather strap; And swiss movment. For this price it's pretty good. I have it since about 3 months and wear it almost everyday.
__label__1 don't bother: If you liked her CD "Warm Heart in a Cold World", (which was pretty cool acoustic music, with great songs that were interesting and worth hearing) don't bother with this one. There's nothing here but a wanna-be Lisa Loeb/Alanis M.
__label__2 Awesome Cover for my S410 camera: This cover is absolutly the best for my S410, perfectly fits my s410 and protects from scratches (Leather is pretty thick - better than i expected), people may complain about no additional pockets, but i dont see the necessacity for additional pockets for s410 or s500 cameras, i have 512 MB CF card which can hold over 300 pictures. and battery lasts practically forever, i still had charge left in the battery after 2 days of continues use and after taking about 200 pictures (more than 100 with flash). for the people looking for case with some additional pockets, they can look at some generic cases but the bulkiness of the case defeats the whole purpose of compact camera.
__label__2 Nice match for the camera.: For under $10, this item should have come with the camera. I bought my Canon S230 and put it in an old "Spectralink" phone case. That really protected the camera and fit well, but just didn't look great. Then I bought my wife the SD200 camera at [...] and the case for the SD200 here at Amazon. The cases completed the cameras. I am left with the more bulky older model and my wife got the SD200. But we both have an interesting set, mine in black, hers in red. For these prices I wouldn't invest in some 3rd party case. Get the genuine Canon case for your camera even if Canon doesn't provide it.
__label__1 GOOD SEVICE TILL NOW: IVE HAD GOOD SEVICE FROM AMAZON.COM TILL NOW JAN.7 7:53PM CST.I WAS PROMISED I WOULD HAVE MY PSC-50 BY TODAY STILL NO PRODUCT.WHEN I FIND OUT WHOM IT WAS COMING FROM I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW TO LET YOU KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM SO YOU CAN BE CAUTIOUS OF THEM.SAD TO BE WRITING THIS REVIEW.ORDER WAS PLACED ON DEC. 25.I KNOW TIME IS ALLOWED FOR THE HOLIDAYS BUT GIVE ME A BREAK. NOW I WAS TOLD TO WAIT TILL JAN.11.BULL HOCKEY.I FINALLY GOT MY CASE OM JAN.10.THREE DAYS AFTER MY ESTAMATED DELIVERY.ITS WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A GLOVE FIT CASE WITH NO PADDING.MY CANON S500 FIT PERFECTLY. I LIKE THE BELT LOOP INSTEAD OF A CLIP LIKE A PAGER BECAUSE IVE HAD PAGERS FALL OFF & BREAK.I SEE AMAZON DESNT CARRY THIS PRODUCT ANYMORE.YOU HAVE TO GET SOME WHERE ELSE.
__label__1 very loose: the color was acceptable, however the size was not fit enough. Therefore, the camera case will look not elegant as I thought.
__label__2 Nice cheap phone sys: Perfect for a small business that doesn't need conference calling.Price was great, works well. Looks very nice too.Very pleased.
__label__1 For high school graduates: Respectable publisher, respectable series. I was expecting presentation level, scope and depth similar to Eberly's "Game Physics". Unfortunately, mistake. This is a book for someone who just graduated from American high school and knows only so called "algebra" (+, -, *, / with calculator, no fractions). No question, there are such individuals, they have to learn, and for them this is pretty good book. I was fooled by impressive Table of Contents and number of pages. Was useless for me. Lesson learned: if you want Eberly's quality, buy Eberly's books
__label__2 Good for laughs: I love this show. I was so excited when they were putting it out on DVD because I thought all I had were memories. That being said, I too was very disappointed in Lionsgate for putting episodes in Season four that were already in Season Three. Like none of us would notice? I highly recommend purchasing the DVD set anyway because ALF will always be great TV, just don't be disappointed if you get part way into an episode and say "I've seen this already..." and it's not because you recently watched it on actual TV.
__label__2 Daily serving of fruit: Nice chunks of dried pineapple. Not crazy about the sugary coating on the outside but I suppose that is to keep them from sticking together.
__label__2 Old Master - A Great Disc: Robert Johnson was the inspiration for generations of blues singers and blues lovers. It seems a great surprise to many that he was also the inspiration for waves of British performers who covered his songs: The Stones, Cream, Led Zep, Eric Clapton, etc., etc.So it's particularly interesting to listen to this disc and hear the power of the original - and remastered to offer sound quality which far exceeds my old scratched records.A definite buy for anyone who loves the blues.
__label__2 I like it.: I'm giving this CD five stars out of five, and here's why. First off, I like how Chevelle stuck to their style with this album instead of changing it up like most bands do with their sophmore albums (if anyone has listened to Jimmy Eat World's new album, you'll know what I'm talking about.) I also like how the sound transitions from heavy to smoothe throughout the songs. Some bands have trouble pulling off those types of transitions, but I think Chevelle did a good job of it on this album. I was already a Chevelle fan after their first CD, and this CD does nothing to hurt that status.
__label__1 Might as Well be a Single!: i give Chevelle's new album "This Kind of Thinking Could do Us In" a 1 for the 1 good song on it..."Vitamin R". Buy the single before you make a mistake of buying this album, cause the other tracks on this cd are junk...a 1 out of 5, TERRIBLE!!!
__label__1 Just wasn't good: Having bought this book based on the review above, i wanted to like this book but it was in no way a page turner. I forced myself to read it and found most of it vapid and inconsequential. There really is no plot so much as conveyances of saratoga scenery from one sex scene to another. I found myself skipping entire chapters and not being lost in the "plot" because of it which says to me that much of the writing was just filler. Many of the characters actions and reactions to different situations just didn't ring true and then of a sudden the book just kind of ends. It sounds like i'm being uncommonly harsh but having just finished two historical page turners in a row my disappointment with this book grows. I only give it the second star because i actually finished it.
__label__2 makes great popcorn: Very easy and fast to use. I have a gas stove and have had no problem making popcorn on medium heat. I have used the butter flavored oil for added flavor. I look forward to taking this camping this summer.
__label__1 great idea - but not in aluminum!: We love the idea of this popper, and used it at least once a week for a year. It worked great, but when it developed a pinhole in the bottom, right in the center, and oil started to seep out onto the hot burner, we got weary. And then when it started a small fire on the burner, we threw it out. We'll be replacing it with a stainless steel model (which means it will have to be a different brand).
__label__2 Great popcorn popper! We love it.: We bought this popcorn popper to use for our son's birthday party and on boy scout camp outs but have been using it at least once a week at home since we got it in August.
__label__1 Whirly Pop could be so much better: We received a Whirley Pop as a Christmas gift, and love it, but the construction is very cheap. As a previous reviewer wrote - because the pot is so thin, it deforms after some use. This item would get a 4 if the pot were made of better materials - 5 if the lid would clip on and off a bit easier. A shame since the popcorn is so good!
__label__1 Broke after first use!: The first time I was making popcorn the plastic gear on the top completely shredded when turning the handle to keep from burning-yeah it burnt! Couldn't turn and threw away the popcorn and the popper! Should've lasted longer, it would've been a nice popper.
__label__1 Shoddy and unsafe: I bought 2 poppers, one for myself and one for a gift. I used mine about 3 times and noticed that one of the little wooden knobs had fallen off. I searched for 10 minutes and found one sharp screw pin in my popcorn. I never found the other pin so maybe we ate it. I sent both back as I dont want my granddaughter to swallow a metal pin. I was so dissappointed since now I have to come up with another gift at the last minute.
__label__1 BIASED REVIEWS: I was interested in purchasing this popcorn maker as part of a gift set. However, when reading the reviews on Amazon.com I realized a serious problem. The reviews are biased. Look through the 79+ reviews. You'll see the majority of the reviews give the product a full 5 stars (which is extremely surprising considering most reviewers are finicky), are written in the same tone/style of writing, and say what a wonderful gift this would make. Many also mention that it's the best popcorn ever and they've used it for several years. Some even venture to say it only works well only if you use Wabash popcorn.If you read reviews less than 5 stars you'll see all writers say this gadget broke/melted within a couple months. There is a serious bias in these reviews and I hope consumers are not being taken advantage of. Some of the high reviews may be valid but I'm quite certain nearly all are false...I've decided not to purchase the item.
__label__1 Construction could be a LOT better.....: The Whirley-Pop model we bought is different from the one shown---the gears are PLASTIC--bad idea #1--and the handle is plastic and set very close to the pot...bad idea #2.The lid stayed on for the first 2-3 uses, then just failed. It's almost impossible to handle piping-hot oil and attempt to keep the lid on. I consider it a definite hazard. The handle on our model is built so that one's hand is directly over the stove burner. Add attempts at controlling the entire contraption with oven mitts and you have a recipe for disaster. I'm too afraid to wrestle with it again--I'm afraid I'll burn myself.Which is a shame, because the popper really makes excellent popcorn. I'd buy another one if it were better-constructed and had METAL GEARS.
__label__1 Don't buy this piece of ####: It was a great idea, it's a shame a good company didn't make it, can't even blame it on foreigners. This piece of crap is a rip off. I did't know you could make a pot out of tin foil, calling it flimsy would be a compliment. As soon as you assemble it and turn the handle once to see how it works, you've made a dimple in the bottom of the pot and best of all you can press it back into shape with your fingernail and no effort. The plastic gearing for the turning handle might last 4 or 5 uses. The only thing that was well made was the wooden handle. I guess they were out of balsa wood that day.DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Save your money for good popcorn at the theatre.
__label__2 Way better than microwave popcorn: The WhirleyPop makes great tasting popcorn, really quickly. It's not much more trouble than microwave popcorn in about the same amount of time, and the results are *far* superior to microwave. It's also a lot of fun to use!
__label__1 not sturdy enough: The plastic gears on these poppers do not grip to the metal post/crank and slip. Any resistance results in the user turning the handle but no movement within the popper. Worked great for first year of average or less use but now, pretty intermittant and a really, more pain than worth. I only continue to use it to keep oil buildup off of other pans. We shake, not crank, now. Won't buy another as it's unfortunately yet another disposable product that overloads landfills.
__label__2 Even works will cooking spray! Toasts other items (inca corn): I really love this thing. Someone was giving one away, and I was surprised to see it on amazon! I love mine. I actually gave away my microwave popcorn popper because I ave this. I feel better eating something not microwaved, and it is just as fast! I toasted that inca corn with it. It came out great! Much lower in calories than if I fried it like the packet said. I dont even pour oil, I just use oil spray (try a misto! That would be best). When you pop with no oil, just spray a little oil spray on the popcorn afterward, to make salt stick.
__label__2 Good Eatin'!: I love this popper!! It is a fun and easy way to have a healthy and delicious snack. I purchased it two years ago and have eaten microwave popcorn only ONCE since then. Yuck! Once you prepare your popcorn with the Whirley-Popper, you will not want another bag of nuked popcorn ever again.
__label__1 Something is wrong here: I agree with a previous review---something about the accolades is biased here (consider the repeating phrases).This does not produce great popcorn. I bought the unit with the special Wabash popcorn pouches touted to have won awards. I have used several, and the popcorn is not crisp, but is chewy, not particularly special in flavor, and full of saturated fat because of the coconut oil blend in the pouches.The unit is flimsy, prone to bending, and IMO does not produce popcorn as good as Popsecret Homestyle or Orville's Movie Theater microwave popcorn.Avoid this item! Within weeks I had to dispose of it.
__label__2 Best popcorn: This makes the best popcorn I've had and with only a teaspoon or so of oil.I have used mine for about 10 years but I think it is time for it to be replaced. It only has one small dent and a nice "patina" on the inside but the gears are finally giving out. I have a new one that I had bought for gift-giving purposes but I think it will be staying with me while the old one is "retired."I have more than gotten mine money's worth although now I am spoiled and won't eat microwave popcorn any more.
__label__1 WhirlyPop popper is kinda cheezy: Inexpensive, but IMO pretty poorly constructed. The idea is good (pop all the kernels --- and it does that) but it is poorly put together with barely marginal parts that slip and so ultimately we just tossed it and went back to the old pot. Cannot recommend to buy.
__label__2 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper: Product works fine although it looks fragile, pay attention to instructions, use med-high heat for popping and turn crank slowly, great with white pop corn as well as yellow. Easy clean up.Would not recommend theater type popcorn initially supplieds
__label__2 whirley Pop: We love this, popcorn cooks real nice and fluffy in this pan easy to use. hand crank is easy to use and located in a easy to reach place.
__label__1 not impressed: this takes up too much cabinet space for it's usefulness. i much prefer my hotair popper. it is awkward to hold on to and if you use some of their crazy recipes that include sugar or other sticky ingredients, it is a pain to clean.i really do not care for this item.
__label__1 Gear mechanism broke after about 5 uses.: This popper made terrific tasting popcorn, but the turning gearmechanism on the top of the pan is made of plastic, and broke afterI used the pan about 5 times. The pan heats up very hot, and theplatic is a poor choice to use in the turning mechanism.They should of used metal.
__label__2 Remind me of my childhood!: I gave this to my 76 year old grandmother for a gift because she can not use the microwave due to a pacemaker. She loved it and is always making popcorn now. The popcorn that came with it was the best popcorn we ever tasted. The only problem she has is that it is hard to use when she is having problems with her hands. She says "I love it no matter if my hand hurts!" LOL
__label__2 best popcorn popper ever: I have used several poppers, auto, air etc.. This is the best! Yes, you have to stand over it for 3 to 4 minutes but it pops almost every kernel. I have used the cheapest corn and the best-same results. You have to follow the instructions otherwise you will writing a negative review. It works as designed! I would buy this again or as a gift for anybody!
__label__2 Great Product!: This is the one I had originally for over a year till it fell off the top of the fridge and the lid broke. Very sad for us because we love popcorn! I tried a different version of a different brand from Fleet Farm and that one was terrible! Whirley-Pop is the way to go!
__label__2 Electric blue!: I'm a HUGE fan of SFX - it goes on well and has staying power. The colors stay bright after repeated washing and they don't bleed on to everything. Love this shade for a bright blue.
__label__2 Study-worthy.: I found this in an effort to lead a Women's study on women in ministry. I had dug long and hard to find a concise review of various impacting Christian-women's tales all in one place. It is hard to find Christian women biographies - esp of Living women. I appreciate the author's research (and that she narrowed to 12 women, when she interviewed many more).Each chapter is a very brief overview of each woman, but it shows us Christian women who are all over world and most are still ALIVE! In our study, we've noticed how powerfully God uses women - in many different ways, in all countries. Each woman in book seems to start small, ask God for guidance, then He helps them see more of His Big vision and we see how they act on it.Not amazingly written, and each bio may bring up more questions than it answers, but it's a start for world-perspective on being a Christian.
