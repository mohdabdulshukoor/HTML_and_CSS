__label__1 Missing over 80 pages...!: I have found that the entire "N" section and a good deal of the "M" section have not been included in this book, due to an obvious misprint! Beware, buyer!
__label__1 Movie Guide: The book is comprehensive. Very seldom you try to look up a picture or video which is not in the book. The reviews are sometimes too short, however, the book would be too unhandy if every picture had a bigger review. Also the facts about the different movies are accurate and helpful.
__label__2 Great Collection: Johnson Records stars were the Dubs and the Shells, but the other groups althoughnot as well known also give a good accounting of themselves.
__label__2 Good album, continuing the hits.: This is another good album from Switchfoot. Unfortunately in the omaha area, the song "oh! Gravity" has not been played on the stations I listen to, so this album snuck up on me for release. Its good, but I honestly like the last album Nothing is Sound a bit more, a little more rock edge. This album is solid, but nothing that seems groundbreaking for them, although it is a good continuation of their sound. Much more of a poppy feel in my book. I don't here the big air play singles on this album Like "dare you to move", "meant to live", or "stars". Still a great album to get, available at a major electric discount stores with 2 bonus tracks and a bonus download.
__label__2 great gaming and working accesorie: you will newer get wrong with it, the movement is very smooth, and it has two sides for diffent tipe of people, you have to use each side to find out which one is more comfortable for you, i recommend this mouse pad for every one.
__label__1 Wake Up Amazon We need a CORRECTION !: People do not buy this album until the error on this itemhas been corrected the album does not match the description.Even as an import it should not cost $50.00. I Really Lovethe Artist but this is hurting her album sales. I hope this willbe corrected soon I would like to see what tracks are actually on the import.
__label__2 A unique book for any gardener or nature-lover: Clare Leighton's woodcuts are exquisite alone, but her writing is simple and elegant enough to quietly intensify their impact. I enjoyed the book so much I'm ordering 2 more - one for a British friend who can especially enjoy the references to native birds and flowers, and another for my elderly mother who will enjoy memories of being a child who spent time in her family's garden during the the time Leighton chronicles so well.
__label__2 Great read.: This is an excellent book. It was recommended to me by a friend and worth every penny. Extremely motivating. I have two other books in the series that I enjoy just as much.
__label__2 A Wonderful book to help you walk closer with God: I got the audiobook from the library, and after I returned it I missed it so much that I went out and bought the book. I carry it in my purse so that I have it if I need it. It is a wonderful book to read in any time, weather you are already prayerful and feeling close to God, or when you feel like you are falling away from God and you don't know how to find him. I recomend this book to any woman!
__label__2 Not great, but entertaining: "Mammoth" reminded me a little too much of "Timeline" and "Jurassic Park" in places, but it was an enjoyable read nevertheless: perfect for a rainy day!
__label__1 crap: Firstly, the buttons seem to protrude too much, cauing them to be depressed unintentionally. After about a week a couple of the buttons seemed to jam up. A week later the display turned off completely. All this after only 2 weeks of wear. This watch is a poorly designed piece of crap.
__label__2 Earth: In James Powell book about the evolution of Earth and the dating techniques was interesting to read about. It is amazing how much we can find out about Earth just by studing certain things or by looking into space.
__label__2 At 23 cents per movie, you're getting your money's worth.: Honestly, the title and packaging are misleading; this is a pile of crap, but it's four-star crap. Seriously, while the general movie viewer will be disappointed in this collection, anyone with an interest in typical movies of the period will be delighted to get so much for so little.
__label__1 Not my idea of classic: Unless "classic" just means old. I do love old movies and when I had TV I watched a lot of old movies. I also love musicals, but I was sorely disappointed with this collection. There are 4 discs of movies in the package and of all the so-called classics, I had only heard of or previously seen 4 of them. I suppose this is not a terribly bad value for the price, but I already have "Royal Wedding" on another disc featuring Fred Astaire, and I wouldn't have purchased this set just to get the Dorsey Brothers film. I think this set would be a good buy for students of Black History in the Arts.
__label__2 PJ Toronto: I was at this show and I think it was top quality thanks to the participation of the crowd. During 'Wishlist' the entire arena put their arms up during the line '50 million arms upraised...' which seemed to both surprise and thrill Eddie (I think you can hear him kind of chuckle right after the line). Additionally, the crowd participation turned Baba O'Riley from an appreciated cover into a real event. This CD really captures an imperfect, yet perfect show from one of the world's top live bands.
__label__1 Im chanting "nooooooo": I was really put off by the chanting, I guess mostly because the cover of the box did not tell me this was a chanting yoga video. I also found the instructor's approach to be distracting and annoying. But mostly, it was the chanting.
__label__1 The voice!: The session has its points, namely the explanation of the poses, as some of the other reviewers have stated. But I cannot get past her annoying, grating voice! I have not been able to actually complete a workout: not because of the difficulty of the poses, but because of that voice. "Monotone" doesn't begin do justice! I must admit, I'm somewhat sensitive to this issue, being a professional singer and voice teacher. However, the number of other reviewers who mentioned this distraction leads me to believe that this is something that Ms. Doane should adjust in future tapings. Again, her "interview voice" was perfectly pleasant. This was my first purchase of a Nicki Doane yoga video; it would take a notice that she has revamped her instructional delivery, and at least an audio preview to entice me to purchase another.
__label__1 Only for someone who has *never* done astanga: What a letdown. I have done a lot of astanga, but bought the "beginners" DVD because I am not terribly flexible and have had some injuries. According to the box, it's a 1 hour, 40 minute program, which would be a normal time to get through the entire astanga first series poses. But in reality, only 55 minutes of this DVD is poses, and she only gets through some of the standing poses -- at a glacial pace. I felt like I'd barely gotten warmed up, and she was laying down for sivasana. I do not recommend this DVD unless you have literally never done an astanga series.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER !: AMAZON, DO NOT SELL THIS PRODUCT TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER !Beware. This toaster is unsafe. I purchased this product on September 27, 2008 and on December 15, 2008, it almost caught my kitchen on fire. The 2 left slots will not eject the toast. Also, the special eject push button does not work. Had I not been in the kitchen, the bread would have caught fire. The bread ended up being so charred it was worthless. So much for assuming the toaster works properly. I have tried contacting T-Fal via the telephone and email. T-Fal sent me an email with "incident # 081213-000013" but to date, no one has contacted me back. The wait-time on the phone is ridiculous. T-Fal should have more respect for consumers. So now, I'm expected to ship the product to a T-Fal service center and pay for shipping on a product that didn't even last 3 months? Please Amazon, remove this product from your store and do not sell it to anyone else. Model # 572727 Ref # TT750150/4YA-4707
__label__1 Great toaster if you want black or undertoasted bread!: We bought the toaster because we liked the look and because there was an overall favorable view of it here. Once we got it home, we discovered it was great at toasting the bread to blackness... or not really toasted at all! We went through an entire loaf of bread to find the right spot to place the dial, and we found that it went from one click made it not toasted at all (not enough to make it more stiff than a regular piece of bread) or blackened to inedibility if we went to the next setting from that!On top of the problem with it not working, it takes up WAAAAAAAY too much space on the counter, and the mechanism it uses to hold the bread in the toaster often keeps the bread from going down all the way.Bottom line: We bought a toaster that is too big and requires us to sit and watch the bread and pop it up manually or we get a burned piece of bread. Not effective on any level.
__label__1 BEHEMOTH TOASTER---BE PREPARED: NO DOUBT YOU HAVE READ ALL THE TECHNICAL REVIEWS.ACTUAL USE IS THAT IT IS A VERY FAST HOT TOASTER. YOU WILL BE PLEASED WITH THE TIME IT TAKES TO TOAST ANYTHING.HOWEVER IT TOASTS UNEVENLY.THE INITIAL PICTURES APPEARED THAT IT IS A UNIQUE DESIGN BUT MANAGEABLE SIZE. BUT THE PINK ELEPHANT IS THAT IT IS HUGE AND APPEARS TO OVERTAKE ALL OTHER APPLIANCES IN THE KITCHEN.YOU MAY HAVE NIGHTMARES OF THIS GARGANTUAN 4 SLICER. IT SCARES ME EVERY TIME I GO INTO THE KITCHEN. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENTERED INTO THE TWILIGHT ZONE.
__label__1 Not made in the USA: My husband and I bought this toaster because it was advertised as being made in the USA. It arrived today and is clearly marked in several places that it is made in China. I will be returning it tomorrow.
__label__2 What a cool toaster: I've never had a toaster before, but I've had plenty of toaster-ovens. After we accidentally torched our last toaster-oven by keeping taco shells in it too long we tried a cheap toaster-oven which actually failed to toast. And here I was thinking toaster-oven technology is so simple and well-known they wouldn't be able to screw it up.So my wife convinced me to try a toaster, and we got this on seeing as it's somewhat mid-priced (no more budget appliances for me!) and it has several cool features - the high-lift lever and the bagel setting. As previous reviewers note, toasting a bagel on only one side makes all the difference.And of course, it just looks cool. We're hipper now that we own it and get invited to a lot more parties.I don't have anything bad to say about it.
__label__1 Not Pleased: I have returned the item, as it did not work properly; toast was done unevenly, and settings did not work at all. Sometimes a lower setting would result in dark toast, and a higher one with too light toast. Considering the price, it was quite a disappointment.
__label__1 Looks Great, Works Not So Much: Great looking toaster, unfortunately I had the same uneven toasting problem that many other people mention. Then it stopped working about a year later. Really not worth it.
__label__2 Toaster: This is a gift. I love it and I think that it will fit in the kitchen just fine, and I know the person I bought it for will love it.
__label__1 Fine while it lasted: When I first received this toaster, it worked just fine, although it is very large and takes up a lot of counter space. Within 6 weeks, though, 2 of the slots stopped working: the lever wouldn't stay down, so we couldn't use that side at all. When I contacted T-Fal about the problem, they said I could pay to ship the toaster to a little repair shop and it might be repaired. I chose not to do that because 1) shipping that giant toaster would cost about as much as buying a new toaster at Wal-Mart, and 2) I would have no toaster at all for an undetermined amount of time while they attempted to fix it. I kept it, and used it as the world's largest 2-slot toaster for 4 more months, until the remaining 2 slots also stopped working. Again T-Fal told me that I could pay to ship the toaster to a repair shop. Paying $60 for a toaster is not a good deal when it doesn't even last 6 months.
__label__1 Floor Toast: Length:: 0:09 MinsI know it's funny the first time you find your toast on the floor. This only happens in the left slot, as far as I have noticed. Will keep you posted.
__label__2 Abolutely Brilliant: One of the best books I've read in many a year.Fast-paced and full of action yet written with a subtle plot which keeps you guessing all the way through the book.A must buy for any Forgotten Realms fan !
__label__1 It's awful...: So I get this in an effort to help my husband sleep while I watch TV late at night. On the second day, the foam ear cover popped off never to be replaced (although I did try and I'm usually good at this kind of thing). Inside the foam ear cover, the plastic knob has a sharp little nipple on it...so to put that side in my ear, I had to get a fingernail file and file down the protrusion. Now I have a foam cover on one side and the plastic ear piece on the other...ok at least the sound works. And then suddenly a month later, it didn't work. It's charged, it is connected right because it used to work but now all I get is static and a faint sound of what is on TV. I have to try and hear what they are saying through the white noise surrounding the sound.....oh, and try and read their lips as I watch the program. It's so much trouble and I spent so much money, I'll just try and sleep!
__label__1 urlfieldtrash: Product works great when it's not broken. Have gone through two in the last two years. First one had an electronic issue. The second broke in half. Product needs to be improved before I buy another one.
__label__2 We both love them....thank you TV Ears: My husband needed the sound up on the TV to be able to hear every word. Some friends had gotten the TV Ears and liked them so much they had purchased a second set. That was good enough for me to get them for my husband for Christmas...at first he wasn't sure as he had tried another type but...after giving them a chance he really likes them and I am happy for the both of us. And a big plus was that Amazon was the least expensive...as they usually are.
__label__1 Think twice ....: I purchased this item for my father-in-law for a Holdiday Gift. He loved them! Then 4 months later the headset broke. I contacted TV Ears and paid over $40 for a replacement headset. Again, my father-in-law was happy. Lo and behold the headset broke again. I contacted TV Ears and again was told $40 something to get a replacement. Warranty is 90 days. I know a 75 year old man isn't like a 3 year old, so I can't blame him for them breaking twice. Don't buy this item unless you are willing to replace headsets at least twice a year!!
__label__2 My new set of ears: The TV EARS work just great I no longer annoy my wife with high volume,the only reason it didn't give it 5 stars was because the ear pads are very hard on the ears and starts to hurt after the first half hour, wish they provided a little more padding.
__label__1 Nice concept; poor execution: Good idea for people who want to watch tv while their partner sleeps. Unfortunatel, very poor design. Earpieces too tight. Also the foam around the plastic part of the earpieces is way too thin to protect the ears from the hard plastic. Hurts your ears after just a few minutes. And the center part that dangles is too heavy and makes the earpieces fall out of your ears.
__label__1 tv ears: After receiving the order found it would not work on my tv without buying some additional "kit". I did not wish to do this so am returning it and don't know if it works or not.
__label__2 Arguably their best: I know alot of Pixies fans will disagree, but I think "Trompe Le Monde" is their best. Don't get me wrong. All of their albums are excellent. Even "Bossanova", which is the cd that gets bummed on the most. Pretty unfairly if you consider some of the other cds that came out in 1990. "Doolittle" and "Trompe" are a pretty close race. But I have to choose "Trompe" just slightly. The thing I love about it is the variety. It shows all of the Pixies' moods to great effect. Punk("Planet of Sound" "U-Mass") Pop("Navajo Know" "Motorway") Spacey("Bird Dream" "Distance =rate"). And of course the fucked-upness that we all love about the Pixies("Subbacultcha")
__label__2 The best Pixies album ever.: This is a great album. It's too bad they broke up. And, nothing that Frank Black has done since even comes close.
__label__2 One of my all time favorite stories: "Cold Light" is one of the best stories I've ever read. I've been looking for years to get another copy of this book simply to read that story again. While the other two stories in the book are very good, it is "Cold Light" which makes this a book to keep in your collection.
__label__2 Dude, you're getting a Del!: l once listened to ''Mistadaobolina'' on repeat for almost an hour and it just got better and better. The rest of the album is so-so, but ''Mistadabolina'' is Del's ''Stairway To Heaven''.
__label__1 Worst, Most Overpriced Curling Iron Ever: Do not purchase. It breaks after 6 months and the company does not honor its warranty.
__label__2 30' full zipper hose cover: Cover did fall short about 8" for my brand new hose with shut off for low volt central vac. I received a dark blue cover, it is fine, I would prefer a choice in color. Otherwise, I think the hose cover will be great in keeping the hose from damaging my floors, walls and furniture. The price was great at under $25 and the shipment came in time, though I was not under the gun to get it delivered.
__label__1 Unreliable Batteries....don't buy or use.: Ultralast AA batteries can be used until you hit a bad one. It'll fizz and pop and pour acid all over the inside of your device, possibly destroying your device. Be careful to wash the liquid off your hands immediately or it can burn through your skin and clothes.If a battery cannot be reliable 100% of the time, then its worthless. Throw all your ultralast batteries away and never purchase them again. Stick to well known brandnames.Ultrafast are cheap for a reason. You get what you pay for. They leak and it's unpredictable as to which batteries will leak and when. I will not use ever again.Use a different brand.
__label__2 Substitue for higher priced battery: Good for use in products which are not used daily. A lower cost alternative to more expensive batteries. Make sure you examine closely for leakage.
__label__1 Disney's Musketeers: Growing up with Disney, my husband and I were dissapointed in this video. Instead of taking the classic humor of things like falling, tripping, being knocked on the head with an anvel, this video uses degrading language as it's humor. By this I mean the character's would call each other names like "stupid" and cut down on one another.We bought this for our 3 year old and didn't think we'd have to review it before he watched it because it's Disney! We ended up having to skip through sections we didn't think age appropriate. We didn't even finish watching the video. I would say the minimum age for this video is 5-6yo.We will be reviewing all Disney videos before we let our children watch them from now on.
__label__2 a change of venue for Baldacci: I'm a big fan of his political thrillers. This book delivered a welcome change of venue and much better than his True Blue attempt to shift gears.
__label__2 The best book I've read this summer: "The Winner" has it all - fast paced, keeps you wondering what the next page will bring. Just the right amount of intrigue, surprise action, realistic characters & romance. This was my first Baldacci novel & it won't be my last - can't wait to read another.
__label__2 Best suspense thriller novel EVER!!: I read David Baldacci's books Total Control and Absolute Power which were terrific, well written and very suspenseful. I have never read a book as fantastic as The Winner. It is the very best book I have ever read - of any category. I couldn't put it down. I referred it to several friends who read it overnite! I cannot properly describe this book to give it the justice it deserves. The story is far fetched but at the same time, the way Baldacci writes it, seems and very possibly could be extremely real. I recommend that everyone read this book!! In fact, I wish I could read it, then forget what it was about so I could read it over and over again.
__label__2 The Winner: this is a great story and a page turner for me. I am always a fan of Baldecci. Good clean read as always
__label__1 The Winner...NOT: The first 2 books were the the winners, not this un-edited, overly long manuscript. Please Mr. Baldacci, don't catch Stephen Kingitis. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
__label__1 Mostly boring and downright stupid!!: A very long repetitous and insipid offering mostly unbelieveable bordering on outright silly- I wouldn't recommend this for anyone..
__label__2 On the edge!: I was on the edge almost the entire time I was reading it. Don't want to give the plot away but I wanted -well, can't tell you what I wanted. Good read and exteremely detailed. Worth every penny.
__label__2 Good Book!: I really enjoyed this book. Better than other Baldacci books I have read. Makes you wonder - can the lottery be fixed? Lou Ann deserved the money - I wish I knew the secret to being as "fit" as she wass to beat up on so many men. Good Girl!
__label__1 too much stupidity: First, the idea of a "fixed result". It's just an impossible thing to happen.Second, the trilling effects were mainly caused by stupidities of LuAnn Tyler herself. This makes reader feels to be fooled by the author...
__label__1 Boring, almost stupid: Wow. It's hard to believe this book was written by the same author who wrote The Sixth Man. The Winner is so boring... no action, don't care about any of the characters. It's almost stupid in parts. I hate not finishing books I paid for so finished it despite the fact it was painful to read.
__label__1 Baldacci's worst - Spoiler: This is Baldacci's worst. I could never get over the fact that this woman got tired of living in Europe and New Zealand. And why did she think she had to keep on the run in Europe, but could come home to the US where she was wanted for murder and settle down. The premise was just plain stupid (please keep in mind that I love Baldacci's other books). If this woman had stayed away, many innocent people would not have died. Yeah, because of her they caught the bad guy, but he had stopped rigging the lottery and killing people long ago. Was catching him really worth more people getting killed? How ironic that after getting these people killed she still got to keep $100 million tax-free.
__label__2 The Book is a Winner: This is a great story because it allows you to think about what you would do in Luann Taylor's (Main Character) situation. The question is: Does she want to win the lottery? She is approached by a strange man who says he can make this happen. She is dirt poor and does not know what to do. This could be her only shot to do something with her life and she can't let it pass her by.A great read for entertainment and an interesting look at the lottery industry. Baldacci keeps you turning the page until the end.
__label__1 A real let-down compared to other Baldacci books: After reading his first two novels, I could not wait to tear into The Winner. What a disappointment. Where his others were fresh, invigorating, and intricately plotted, this one was trite, predictable and utterly absurd. The characters were so one-dimensional it was embarrassing, and the scenarios he had them in were typical cookie-cutter thriller plots. I have a hard time believing the same author wrote Absolute Power and Total Control, two books which I thought were brilliant.
__label__2 Getting out of the trailer is a killer....: Oh LuAnn get out while you can! This book is a great read and sports an interesting storyline. I would strongly recommend this one if you have a few evenings to kill....
__label__2 Great villain: Unlike a few of the other David Baldacci books I've read, *The Winner* was very fun to read. The characters still haven't changed (a gorgeous woman and an ex-FBI-undercover-agent), but Baldacci has managed to make them fun again.It's entirely possible that this is because of the villain in this book. The story isn't really as interesting (although various bits surprised me) as *Absolute Power* or *The Simple Truth*, but the villain was great. The villain, Jackson, is a power-hungry psycho intent on garnering lots of power and outsmarting everyone. Jackson is easily the best part of this book, I think.The story is interesting enough, although most of the book was like "what will Jackson do next?" for me, and the chapters centering on him were easily the best. *The Winner* is worth reading if only because of Jackson.
__label__2 The Winner by David Baldacci: Wow, what a thrill ride this book was! I couln't put it down! It is so well written, and fun to read from the very first chapter. Baldacci is an amazing story teller!!!
__label__1 Very disappointing: Based on the previews and the excellent billed cast, I was expecting a smart and intelligent movie. Instead, I got a terribly self-indulgent, cliched mess of a movie that is mostly the writer-director-star nattering on. She must have extreme narcissism to cast herself to play what I presume was supposed to be a charming and brilliant love interest. But the whole relationship was just creepy and weird, with a large age gap and no chemistry. Adam Scott did his best, but the rest of the great cast was utterly wasted and were clearly there as a favor for this rejected film-school project. Perhaps my high expectations are leading to an overly negative reaction to this film, but either way it was terrible and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
__label__1 Such a great cast: Such terrible writing and direction. The premise was a good one, but the execution left me wondering how you could come up with so less than the sum of the parts.
__label__1 Don't waste your time or money!: Dont waste your time, I couldn't even finish it. Not funny at all, boring as can be. Doesnt even deserve one star
__label__1 Horse manure: Within two minutes of this crass, vulgar so-called comedy, one of the supposedly charming male leads tells a female friend over the phone that she needs to get the cobwebs out of her vagina. Less than 10 minutes in, he's telling her men worry about their partners having a baby because they fret the mother's vaginas will become cavernous and therefore she won't be attractive. And click went the off button. I've seen my wife struggle at times to deal with almost casual sexism that can damage a career, I watch with alarm as my teenage daughter navigates a modern culture where some players seem to delight in putting down women, and Friends with Kids is just continuing that trend. Shame on everyone involved in this pile of ordure.
__label__1 Did not enjoy: I was very disappointed by this movie. This movie promised to be thoughtful and witty with a cast including Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig. I thought the premise of kids changing a group of friends and the couples themselves would be interesting and relatable. The characters proved to be unable to evoke much sympathy from me as they wallowed in their disappointments with life. I found the movie depressing and un-insightful.
__label__2 Think: When Harry Met Sally (Had a Baby): I never write reviews. But I felt the need to defend this one because it's REALLY REALLY GOOD. Jennifer Westfeldt is wonderful. Adam Scott too. The supporting cast manages to pull off rich, 3-dimensional characters with little screen time because all characters are well-drawn and well-cast.Think "When Harry Met Sally." There is no fake orgasm scene, but you do drop in and out of these people's lives as they inch closer toward each other and further away. Toward the end, I half expected Billy Crystal to show up and say "I came here tonight because when you realize that you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."It might not be what people are used to in terms of a "romantic comedy" (or what passes for one today). Instead, it's engaging and true-to-life. I smiled more than I laughed, but I smiled a lot.
__label__1 After a year, it loses value: I've had this flashlight for over a year. The concept was great until time passed and it needed more vigorous shaking just to shine for 30 seconds or less. We kept this flashlight in the car for emergencies. However, it's a pretty long flashlight and we've found smaller flashlights on Amazon that are crank based and therefore take far less effort and shine brighter. For a similar price, you can find these crank flashlights that nowadays use LEDs and offer cell phone-charging capabilities as well as a built-in radio.
__label__2 It works!: It is not a lighthouse, but something that saves the situation.Don't think that you can illuminate your entire house with it! But it really keeps giving light for 2 hours with a little amount of decrease in intensity. So, the description meets the fact!
__label__2 Part fun...Part romantic...Part nostalgic...a nice mix.: A friend lent me the CD to listen to several years ago. I really enjoyed the fast songs, but one song, "More Than The Stars" really caught my ear. So much so, in fact, that it was the song that my wife and I requested for our "first dance" at our wedding reception. It was nice. :-)
__label__1 There need to be some consistent rules in any game.: It's interesting to see the different reactions to the book. I read it first, knowing nothing about it and not looking at reviews. Though I did enjoy reading it, I leaned towards those who found it confusing. My biggest problem was the arbitrariness of the universe we were put in. The rules changed every few paragraphs, so I found that it all became rather arbitrary. After a while I cared less about what was going to happen and certainly gave up trying to make any sense out of it. In the end they somehow got rid of the Prophet but I really have no idea how or why it worked.
__label__1 ok: Can not use, it is bigger than my cabinet I have to see about return it back or find onother use for it
__label__2 Dope ass rims: I got both the front and back rims for my cruiser as well as the white-wall tires. They both were just as shown in the picture, chrome plated and they come with everything you need to put them on your bike. Make sure to have an old coaster break to see how to assemble the one on the back rim because it can be a little tricky. Overall, these rims are awesome. I put the white-wall tires on (also from the same seller) and they are dope!
__label__2 Wonderful pocket reference (not quite pocketsized though): Simple and sweet - good refence, easy lookup structure, fast answers. Anyone dealing with CSS should have this close by.
__label__1 Cute but very diappointing: I am using the iTrip made for the old model of iPod. I have found it very difficult to get good sounding music on this thing. I am used to using the iRock (a battery version with only 4 stations) for long drives. It works much more reliably and the sound quality has been excellent. Even when the iTrip works the sound is often distorted at normal volume-- noises from base and unclear sounding. When I drive really far from even a small metropolitan area the sound clears up, but I have much better reception with the iRock.
__label__1 iTrip - Looks 10 Sounds 1: This device is cute and is engineered perfectly for the iPod. The sound quality I got was marginal at best. It depends on being able to find an unused frequency that is quiet. I found that a good frequency on one side of town would be noisy on the other side of town, and I was always changing channels trying to get and keep a good station.High marks for ergonomics, size and for the ability to generate ohs and ahhs. The underlying FM technology is problamatic. The power it's allowed to use for broadcast is weak and any strong FM station on a nearby band will overwhelm it.I found the same problem with the Transpod (a competiing product) which used an analog tuner instead of a digital tuner. The transpod was subject to drift, but you could - for 5 or 10 minutes, get pretty good sound by having a light touch on the dial.My recommendation - a cassette adapator.
__label__1 Very frustrating to use: This has to be about the most frustrating piece of hardware I've purchased recently. In two of my vehicles it doesn't work most of the time and in another vehicle it works for 15-20 minutes before a radio station cuts in, if I'm lucky. I used the iTrip in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose with equal frustration. In my opinion it is not worth its high price (or any price). You won't want to show off your iPod while using this device. Very disappointing.
__label__1 not worth it: I bought this hoping to use the iTrip in the car, but the signal is terrible. It's so fuzzy its not even worth listening to. If you have a stereo at home and you place the iTrip within a few inches of it, this is the only time the iTrip does anything. Also, having the iTrip stations mixed in with songs is annoying.
__label__1 Who designed this thing: This has the worst interface.. look elsewhere. It is tightly integrated with the ipod but in a horrible horrible way. look for one that you can set the station external to the ipod and it stays. If you are driving and tryign to use this you will probably crash. I am not joking this is one of the worst designed products I have ever seen.
__label__1 Won't work in a city!: Dont but this product. Maybe if you live in the middle of nowhere it will work. But you have to find a FM frequency that is perfectly silent for it to work, and even then the quality isn't very good. In NYC or Boston, there are no stations that work well at all. I got this and thought it was awesome for about 5 minutes and then got extremely frustrated as the music sounds horrible on every station around here.
__label__1 This is crap!: The luggage handle was broken after 2 days later i purchase. It looks useful but i think the maker do not consider how it get weight. Inside of bag was just cheap ass plastic. I mean It is going to be very easily broken. you cannot put stuff or tools like picture. I literally waste my $50.
__label__2 Brenda and cheese?: This work represents deep, textual layering that shouldn't intimidate with its elevated tone. Sentences are highly structured and extremely literate with references to women's rights struggles, soviet nationalism and yes, even good old-fashioned romance.These poems don't require patience so much as deserve repeated visits. Like a fine cheddar, the work accrues in value as it ages. Simply devine.
__label__2 Great Item: The Toro Blower/Vac is great. The power is just right for either blowing leaves and grass or vacuuming. A high quality product.
__label__1 Toro leaf vac awkward at best: I bought this Toro leaf blower to replace a Black & Decker one that the motor quit working after 4 years of light duty. All the reviews weregreat on this toro, metal impeller instead of plastic and how powerfull this one was etc etc. I found this Toro to be "Awkward" to hold, no real balance to it with the bag. The cord was coming out the front (which I kept tripping on and coming unplugged. I found the dial up variable speed power switch to be annoying as well, I liked the Black and Decker 2 speed select switch better. As far as suction power again I thought it had less than the B&D.; If I had to do over i would take a pass on the Toro.
__label__2 leaf blower: Toro Ultra 12 Amp Electric Blower/Vacuum #51599. Bought for my son and he loves it. It works great and is a lot stronger than others just like the advertisers said. If you want to make the greatest leaf piles in the world for your kids and want to do it in half the time, this is the tool for you.
__label__2 Toro blower/vac: I received the product in very good condition, very fast deli. Have not had a chance to use it yet because it is still winter, but going by the reviews is should be fine.
__label__2 Toro Ultra Electric Blower/vacuum: This is a very powerful yet light tool that is easy for a woman to use. I like how it mulches the leaves and reduces the need to use lots of yard bags.
__label__2 Kay H Hill from Rocky Mount NC: This was shipped from Amazon and arrived on time: I LOVE IT: I can vacuum around the pool, and the flower beds. The blower it great also. I like buying from Amazon.
__label__1 Blower died after one 10 minute use: I used the unit on my asphalt driveway to blow away a light sprinkling of leaves and pine needles. It worked great. Only had to use it for less than 10 minutes it was so fast. I pulled it out the next day for the same purpose. The blower would not power up. I tried different extension cords and outlets. Nothing worked. The motor or electrical died. Just a bad unit I guess. I am exchanging for replacement. Will update review later.
__label__2 Great mulcher: Most Leaf vac/blowers have a plastic impeller. If you are looking for a good vac that mulches the leaves, this is a good investment. The impeller on this tool is metal with mulching heads integrated into the impeller. Other vacs that I owned, with plastic impellers, did a poor job of mulching and the impeller would break if you sucked up stones or even acorns.Good value and works great.
__label__2 Toro Ultra 12 amp electric blower/vac model51599: Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum With Metal Impeller #51599I purchased this item on 10/5/2008.Received it in a reasonable time frame and item was in excellent condition.My experience using the Toro blower/vac took a short time getting familiar with and balance control.The Toro does its gob well in vacuuming leaves,I recommend low setting for light leaves and max. setting for heavy leaves such as oak leaves.Relatively quiet and thick plastic housing so it will take a lot of abuse.But i do recommend to the manufacture that their zipper bag on reverse side have a more uniform zipper seam becouse leaf particles cling to zipper seam and could cause problems opening and closing.Thankyou Amazon!
__label__1 DO NOT BUY! WON"T LAST>>>MINE DIED AFTER 3 YEARS: Take my advice don't buy one of these because it won't last. After three years of very very light use the motor bearings went out and would only operate at a fraction of the speed than when new. I never used the vacuum so I know it wasn't from sucking up something that would've harmed the bearings. They don't even sale a replacement motor I replaced a craftsman that lasted 15 years with this piece of crap. Made in Mexico, if that gives you a hint. Buy a good crasftman, that's what I'm going to do.
__label__2 works great: This blower vac was all I expected it would be. The control which lets you dial the speed I found very useful. The lower speed gives much better control. I was able to clean my garage without blowing everything away. As a leaf vac / multcher it worked great. The only problem I had was that the bag got too heavy for me. Oh well, I am a 64 yr old woman. I found that I could rest the bag on the ground & just move the bag a bit at a time where the leaves were deeply layered. Where they were scattered I switched to the blower and piled them up. I chose this ToroToro 51599 Ultra 12 amp Variable-Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum with Metal Impellerbecause it has the metal impeller. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
__label__2 Excellent Blower at a Good Price: I was looking for a strong blower that was also relatively quiet. This electric model from Toro met both requirements. I have used the blower several times and have not been disappointed. While most of the reviews for this product are very positive, several mention the motor burning out after a short time. It is very important to follow the extension cord ratings for both gauge and length when using this product. If you use a light duty extension cord or exceed the length recommendations you are going to burn out the motor.
__label__2 Good, but could be better: My previous Toro had a plastic impeller, so when it no longer worked (the electrical connection pulled out), I shopped around, but still came to the conclusion that the 51599 was still one of the best ones on the market. The old one worked quite well, so I thought I'll try another one. I like the fact that it has more than 2 speeds, although the top speed doesn't seem to be as fast at my previous 2 speed model. I think this is a good product except that a convenience in my previous model to wrap the extension cord around to keep it connected, is missing on the 51599. All of my electrical outdoor gear have this item built into their devices, so I'm really curious as to why Toro decided not to place it on the 51599. It would make this model even better. As far a performance, it is loud, but very effective. If this one dies, I can only hope Toro reads these reviews and will install a device to wrap the cord around to keep everything connected.
__label__1 Out of Balance: My previous Toro was the same model and lasted four years until the motor gave out (I would have given it 5 stars). I purchased a new one and immediately noticed this one had a vibration and more noise even at low speeds. I returned it for another of the same model and this one is better but still not as smooth and quiet as the old one was. I will be returning this one and looking for another brand.
__label__2 leaf vac blower: I like the blower attachment on the front but the vacuum tube is straight down which requires you to "get into" your pile of leaves to vacuum. I like the variable speed control.
__label__1 JUNK: Blower worked fine under very light duty (leaf blowing only. no mulching) for EXACTLY one year and then burned out. Sounded like a battery operated tool slowing down over about 5 minutes until it totally stopped. I expected way more from a product with the name TORO on it. Just more foreign made crap.
__label__2 Good Machine but poor quality bag: This performs quite well, however if you suck up certain items (such as small pebbles or sticks, twigs, etc) they can blow through the bag, the zipper side is what fails, there seems to be some design flaw/weakness, so I would buy a backup bag or two if you can find one. I use it for cleaning my garage/driveway/sidewalk and it does a very good job, plenty of suction.
__label__2 Plenty of Blow Power: Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum With Metal Impeller #51599This must be one of the most powerful electric blowers around. And if you ever want to pick up and grind leaves it does a good job of that with the metal impeller. I did find the suction tube to be too small for large Magnolia leaves, but it works well with anything smaller. I found it a bit difficult to manage with the bag slung over your shoulder. It is a bit heavier than my previous blower, and the handle configuration also made it more difficult to handle, but then perhaps with more use I'll get the hang of it. For blowing power, however, it can't be beat. And best of all, it is much quieter than its gas powered brothers which I find to be soooo... annoying when the neighbors crank them up in the morning.
__label__2 Fantastic!: I tried out two (quite expensive) gas blowers before giving up and getting this one. It's not even close -- this thing blows them away, quite literally. I was able to accomplish twice the cleanup with half the effort of the gas blowers. Do not hesitate to buy this thing -- you'll be relieved to have such a useful fall cleanup tool.
__label__2 Happy Buyer: I am very impressed with the Toro Blower/Vacuum... The Blower is VERY powerful and is adjustable. The vacuum is also very impressive. The only down side so far has to be the cord.. We have a huge yard and the cord only reaches so far. (I suppose I can solve that by buying a longer cord) Also the vacuum is a bit time consuming versus just picking up the leaves by hand. You do save a lot of time by blowing the leaves in to a pile instead of having to rake them though.Overall we are extremely happy!
__label__1 Toro 12 amp electric blower: The first time the blower was used it lasted for less than a minute and smoke started coming out of the engine. I returned the product to an authorized repair center and still have not received the unit back. It has been almost 4 weeks since it was dropped off. Now it is snowing so it doesn't do me any good...
__label__1 Over Rated: This blower vacumn is over rated. It is heavy and cumbersome to handle. Does not do a good job of vacumning up leaves. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 Very Pleased!: My Toro 51599 just arrived today (sooner than expected, yay!) and for the last 3 1/2 hours it's been cleaning up part of the yard where I can't effectivly mow the leaves. I am surrounded by old trees and have a huge yard, so this machine will have plenty to do. I was very impressed with its power and effectiveness! The leaves were dry but not all were withered yet. I used it as a blower to create some big piles to make sure there weren't any large twigs in the mess. When it did suck up ones that I was a little concerned about, it never faltered. I got braver and vacuumed an ivy bed without pre-inspecting it. It encountered some old damp leaves under the newer ones and handled all the material, including twigs, very well. Switching from blower to vacuum is easy. The bag holds just enough to not be unmanageable for me. I like that it is quieter than my other old blower and the vacuum feature with metal impeller makes it a real winner.
__label__1 Great but gets you dirty....: The Toro was bought for me to use in cleaning up my rose beds. I used it and it had good vacuum pressure and did a good job the only thing was it filtered dirt all over you.
__label__1 Three in a row broke down!: I've had three Toro Variable-Speed electric blower vacuums in the space of five years. The first one broke down (just plain stopped working) about two weeks after I bought it. I took it back to the store and they exchanged it for a new one. The second one worked fine until just two months after the two-year guarantee ran out. I really liked the way the machine handles and how efficiently it blows leaves (a big deal here in New England!), so I bought another one. That one managed to keep running eight months after the guarantee ran out, when it too broke down (today). I'm going to see if Toro is going to help me out here, but I don't have a lot of hope.If they won't do a replacement, that's it for me and Toro. There must be other machines out there that have at least a little more reliability!
__label__1 Poor shredder: Poor shredder. I have had three of these machines that failed just at warrantee time. The shredder reduces about 10% at most not hat is advertised. The blower and vacume is adequate but not very good. Raking is quicker. Next time I will not replace this with the same product and seek another make.
__label__2 Works good: Only used it once so far. It was fairly easy to switch between blowing and vacuuming. I just needed to figure out that it is much easier to blow all the leaves into a pile first instead of vacuuming them one by one. (doh)! A large pile of leaves (lets say 4x4) filled the bag and then only filled my YW container a fourth of the way. I'm sure those will settle as well so it really saves space by having the leaves chopped. This has a metal mulcher instead of others that have plastic so I think this is better. Like I said, only used once, but it seemed to work well.
__label__1 variable speed knob failure: I bought the Toro 51599 in May. Now it's December. While I was blowing leaves for the final time this season, the variable speed switch no longer worked. It won't turn off and it won't change speeds. Now I can turn it off only by unplugging it. Is 7 months the normal time before failure? Bummer!
__label__2 Toro 51599: I replaces by 10 year old Toro with this model. It is super!! I have 2 negative comments. They are minor. Attaching the vacuum tube is cumberson. My old Toro was easier to attach and remove. Also, I do not like the way the extension cord is secured.Other than those 2 minor items, the device is superb. It picks up leaves and small twigs and sticks easily and the metal blades are stronger than previous nylon/plastic blades.I would recommend this and would buy it again.
__label__2 it is what it is: This was what I wanted but not pricey. It is exactly what it looks like in the picture. I just wished I could change the batteries instead of throwing it away when it dies.
__label__2 My favorite comedy: I have all the seasons this show is the best charlie day is now one of my favorite actors he made this show and horibble bosses was awesome as well you got to love every person in this show it is and awesome cast and would not be the same withought any one of them season 7 is vary funny due to mac being fat that took the cake dennis, Dee, and frank best family ever haha oh and i guess charlie due to that is franks thought to be aboarded child
__label__2 Another Sunny review!: This show never seems to get stale, they always find a way to be original and hilarious. Another great season form the folks of Philly!
__label__2 The best action movie ever: This is agreat film an Indiana Jones is possible the best action hero of all time. I still want to know why amazon says its rated R. Originaly it was going to be R but they changed it to PG so more people to see it (PG in 1979 was like PG-13). Raiders of the Lost Ark is a great for kids around the age of 13. I give it 2 huge thumbs up.
__label__2 The Voice of Comfort: Anyone who can relate to the struggles of everyday human life can relate to Tracy Chapman's music. She let's you know that she's been there too, and that you're not alone.
__label__1 Broke apart on first swat.: I got this as a gift a couple of months ago, and finally pulled it out of the package. I put batteries in, pushed the button on the side, and nothing happened...No light or anything. I figured I would try it on a fly and see if it worked even though the light didn't illuminate. I saw a fly, pushed the button, swinged, and....CRACK....the handle broke apart. I was left holding the batteries, and the racquet fell to the floor. One star is too generous.
__label__1 Product description is misleading.: While this product is suitable for quarantining small animals or transporting them to veterinary care, this is not nor ever could be a permanent housing choice for ANY fish specimen. Given its size it cannot be heated safely so tropical fish would not fair well for long.What I have used this product for was to provide temporary safe harbor inside my reef tank for a recently purchased cinnamon clownfish so that my existing clown didn't immediately tear him limb from limb and the two could familiarize themselves without injury.This product is certainly useful in some aspects, but certainly not as it's advertised -- as a permanent fixture/home for a live animal or fish.
__label__2 Linda Ronstadt: can't get any better: She is perhaps the best living singer in the world (in any language). Fabulous CD.
__label__2 Beautiful Singing: Linda sounds great. The music sounds great.... this is a must have for any collection.
__label__1 Picture shown is not the item: The picture shown here is the handlifter assembly. Part No. 63014-01 is not the handlifter - it's only a couple of extra parts. The picture should depict the parts, not the actual lifter.
__label__2 Wonderful production: I am a huge Michael Jayston fan so this is a biased review, but he is excellent in this part. I enjoyed it very much. It's also fun to see "Catherine de Bourgh" from the A&E "Pride and Prejudice" when she was young. Other good actors too.
__label__2 Satisfaction, Guaranteed.........: Was totally satisfied with my purchase. Broke my phone cord. Went online, straight to Amazon of course. All purchases prior to this one, were awesome. Ordered my headset, was told that I would recieve my purchase on one day, it actually came earlier then date given. Now how cool is that. Will never go anywhere else. Love you Amazon....
__label__1 item did not work with the S10 - returned item, still have not received refund: This item stated it worked with S10, but it did not, I returned it and still have not received a refund!!!!
__label__1 Not worth the money: Was excited to get this product, as a few of my co-workers have this brand name, but sadly found out no one could hear me. Back to the handset.
__label__2 HELLYEAH = FU*KING NASTY!!!!!: This album is pure fu*king sick!!!. Chad is an amazing vocalist, Greg just as amazing on the guitar. I have no following of Nothingface but if this is any indication to what they do, Im going to become real fimiliar! Then you have somebody that needs no introduction what so ever on drums. Vinny Paul, I dont even have to put anything by his name, Vin has proved his importance over many many years. This is the amaculate Metal band! You are covered on all corners..CHEERS MOTHER FU**ERS!!!! GO GETCHA HELLYEAH!!!!
__label__1 HELLNO!!!!!!: what the hell mudvayne i thought that u guys were'nt going to split i guest wrong why HELLYEAH
__label__1 Terribly unhelpful: Luckily I only checked this out from the library. It's almost as if they didn't know the test content at all. Plus there were several glaring mistakes. I recommend everyone stay away from this. Cliff's 2nd Edition was the best CSET Multiple Subject guide I found.
__label__1 If you want to feel prepared for the CSET...don't buy this book: This book did an awful job at preparing me for the CSET . I spent weeks reading through the book and taking the practice tests only to walk into the exam, open the test booklet and feel like I knew NOTHING that was in front of me. I feel that I would have been better prepared if I had just walked in off the street and taken the CSET with absolutely no "review" from this book. On a side note, there were also quite a few editing errors in the book (a multiple choice question in a practice test with no answers to choose from, for instance). Bottom line, don't buy this book if you want to feel prepared for the CSET.
__label__2 A MUST HAVE for Nursery start ups: Gotta say the author gives a realistic picture of starting a nursery business. By the time you finish this you will have a clear picture of the business basics. If you are looking for a book on how to grow plants look elsewhere - this is a practicle guide to starting the business. Includes the Web address for additional info.EXACTLY the information I needed!
__label__1 ZZZZZZZZZZ: A box of tuneless overindulgent snoozefest riddled drivel.Rush said more on Permanent Waves than DT have on their entirecatalog.
__label__1 Too many script errors: Also frustrating for kids. Claims to use some kind of adaptive process to alter difficulty of the game, but this just results in a long list of repetitions of the same game before you get anywhere. Very frustrating for little kids.
__label__1 Factory Error with this game?: I truly believe that there was some kind of factory error with this product. I researched and read about this version (Kindergarten Advanced) and the reviews said that the goal was to complete the tasks in order to get your car ready for the big race (hence the picture on the box). I purchased the software, installed it and the newest Jumpstart Kindergarten World edition is what came up. This is a completely different game that sells for $10 more and is what people are talking about with the monthly subscription. The disks were labeled correctly, but the content was the wrong version. After a lot of pleading the store finally took the product back. It's unfortunate because the regular Advanced version got good reviews, but obviously this has happened to a lot of people, so I'm not going to take my chances again.
__label__1 How Do You Play These Games?!?!?!?!?!: My 5 year old daughter is out there crying right now because this stupid game which doesn't come with ANY instructions just made her little doggie disappear and we can't find it and there are no directions! There are only two games to play on the pet playground game and they are lame. I feel like I wasted my money. And we still can't find that stupid dog. It's like torture for your kindergartener!!!
__label__1 Too brief for real use: The book is made up of a collection of editorials from FAIR, the public-interest watchdog group. The articles are short and not particularly incisive, and focus on the usual transgressions of America's corporate-owned media. As a reference source Cohen and Solomon's book is not particularly valuable: the articles are simply too brief to provide much useful depth or information. Moreover the groupings lack real coherent unity that follow through on the theme. Still and all, a revisit of Upton Sinclair's struggle against the entrenched wealth of his day (1920's & 30's) provides useful perspective on today's media struggles. And the beat goes on.
__label__2 Not prime?: we love curious george. we were very excited when we saw it was added to prime instant video..however it is still trying to charge me $1.99 for it..
__label__1 DON'T BUY THIS DRIVEL!: My toilet is more interesting.High school effort at best.I fast forwarded through it & gave it away.I give it 2 buns down.;(
__label__2 car bra for Envoy: a good tight fit it was , the only problem areas were the far corners of the bra, but believe it was a good purchase and well worth the money
__label__1 weak: fortunately, this book was part of a bundle and I did not have to pay for it. If you are new to RTS games, then it might be of some use. Otherwise, what person with any brains would not know to put weaker missile units behind sturdier melee ones? I mean, really, it's that basic.
__label__2 A Hidden Treasure!: I discovered this music while researching ballet suites. Wonderful, colorful orchestration. Some exquisite melodies!I am researching to find more information about the man - any posts would be appreciated.
__label__2 Remarkable Film: Once again, another remarkable piece of work by Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan. Bollywood drama about two lovers from the same village separated by an arranged marriage. Six years later they meet in Calcutta and catch up on old times and learn surprising truths about one another. Wonderfully filmed with an O Henry-style Twist.
__label__2 A most interesting history: Cleveland Amory, best known for his writings for his love of animals, first wrote this most interesting view of the city of Boston. Boston is one of America's most well known cities, and Amory gives an insight into the fabric that makes up the social framework of the city. Gilded with facts that give the reader a chance to see how Boston thinks (such as tearing down the historical home of John Hancock when the taxes went unpaid), this book is fascinating because it is real. Truth is stranger than fiction, and Boston as presented here rings true. The main drawback to the book is that one wishes an update on the world of the Proper Bostonians was available.
__label__2 Very happy: Received the caliper very quickly. Very pleased with it, it worksperfectly. Would recommend this item to anyone who wantsto check body fat on a regular basis.
__label__1 Nothing to do with NIN: Nothing to do with NIN cept for the title. It's mildly humorous but pretty stupid nonetheless
__label__2 Very well done: This was a very well written, very well researched biography. It was an interesting read and the authors obviously knew exactly what they were talking about. They interviewed a vast range of sources, had all sorts of good quotes, anecdotes and pictures. I felt like I was getting the real deal. This is the best Bowie biography I've read. (In case you're wondering, I've read five. I'm doing a report for my arts class.) This answers most of my questions about Bowie, my only regrets being that it was published in the mid-eighties, so I don't get any info on what he's doing now....
__label__2 Miraculous Reading!: I found this book making me LOOOOONNNNNGGGG for planning a trip to Cabo & the Sea of Cortez and all along Baja. I ordered this book so that I could help my daughter write a paper for one of her marine biology classes. It had all the perfect ingredients: habitat and ecology discussions; cultures that affect the marine life; whimsical and historical accounts of people, places and events; and a most interesting narrative. I recommend this for a summer reading!
__label__2 Great Example of what ATB can do: Wonderful mix of vocals and that mind numbing sound that ATB brings to the record. A great pick if you are a ATB fan
__label__1 Save your money: Upon removing supposedly "new" unit from box, discovered marred "level" adjustment screw indicating prior misuse. Unit did not work because of poor transmission and faulty female jack plug on transmitter. More than 30 days elapsed between the time I bought the unit and when it was first used and the vendor selling thru Amazon refused to honor a refund or replacement citing their obscure return policy. This device is poorly constructed, cheaply made, non-functional and, in my opinion, misrepresented as factory new when it appeared to be otherwise.
__label__2 Very cool and "enlightening" toy: Another character that the little boy from Ben-10 can change into, this larger action figure is very nice indeed. It converts into a flashlight which, again, allows for more play time (my kids wished that it did that and glowed int the dark as well but that's wishful thinking). It's sturdy and well made. I'd suggest also picking up more than one if you have more than one kid because they'll end up fighting over it otherwise.
__label__1 Not up to 3M usual high quality products.: I do like the fact that this stand has adjustable angles but am taken aback by the price/design ratio. The way that the legs attach to the sides of the support makes the stand wobbly if you are putting heavy books on it. The 3M engineers did not do their usual excellent job with design on this product.The elastic band is basically like a rubberband my daughter uses in her hair, with two plastic attachments to it. For this price a few extras should have been included. I had envisioned my kids using it to hold up textbooks when working on homework and this stand simply cannot handle the weight.Overall, it works ok, but for this price it should be much sturdier and be nearly perfect.
__label__2 Fantastic!: These are the best document holders. We had an ergonomic evaluation and document holders were recommended for several of the staff members. These are large enough to put right in front of the monitor and hold two columns of documents. You will need a monitor riser if you want it in front of your screen but then it makes a perfectly ergonomic setup.
__label__1 Needs improvement and too expensive: Useful but you need a big desk to find room for this! Also, the price is too much for what you get. Also, kind of wobbly.I would not recommend this for the price. It should either be better designed or half the price. And I don't mean half the list price; I mean half the $60 Amazon price. And even that would be pushing it.
__label__2 So much fun!: This dvd is amazing, I've never done a workout that was so much fun before. I love how fast the hour goes by. The instructor is great and gives all the right reminders. I'll admit though, this isn't for people who've never exercised before. It's super hard, but worth it. I've already noticed a difference in my endurance after doing this dvd only five times in the past two weeks. Also there is some great instruction before the workout even starts on how to punch and kick correctly in all the different forms she uses in the workout. I don't think there could be a better kickboxing dvd out there.
__label__1 Surf City Teresa - PLEASE DON'T STEREOTYPE GIRLS: I consider Surf City Teresa very mediocre. I wouldn't reccomend it to children with vicious dogs, cats, or other animals that might choke on the doll's shredded head, hair, feet, or other parts that easily come off. It is not very fun for children with little imagination, as the dolls can get boring and end up either with their heads pulled off, in the "Barbie Pile", or fed to the bulldog. As Barbie Dolls go, they can get boring after awhile and are not educational.(...)
__label__1 DON'T BUY THEM!: The new TDK Music CD-Rs no longer work in my Pro CD recorder.I've never had a problem with TDK Music CD-Rs in the past but I've tried several spindles of the new CD-Rs with the new labels and packaging and they have been nothing but problems.I have contacted TDK several times about it but no reply!
__label__1 dont use these for the philips cd recorder: I bought 4 packages of these and they were all defective/not for digital audio music recorders. I called tdk which make IMATION media. They told me to check out each disk and send them the defective ones. Well all 200 are defective. So they are gonna send me the correct ones for my recorder. My dual cd philips machine didnt recognize these disks which say tdk music. The recorder rejected every one. Either it gave a error or said insert disc meanwhile it was in there. I dont recommend these model # discs for the philips dual cd recorder. I always bought tdk all my life and since Imation is involved i no longer buy them. I use maxell only for the dual philips recorder. I bought 200 discs and work flawlessly. If you have the philips cd-r dual deck use the maxells they are worth it. They say on them cd-r music for DIGITAL AUDIO 80 min and are used for the philips dual deck.
__label__1 Give it up, William!: Oh great, another one? More terrible music from William Hung, America's favorite American Idol reject. Would somebody please give William the message? We hated 'Inspiration,' and we hate 'Miracles: Happy Summer!' even more.These little messages that William does in the middle of the song are worthless. I've listened to them, and it's almost like, 'Wow. What a waste of time!' You don't buy the records to listen to the dialogue! But then again, why do you buy the records period in this case?Overall, if you thought 'Inspiration' was funny, chances are you'll love 'Miracles: Happy Summer!.' But if you hated 'Inspiration' as much as I did, than you'll hate 'Miracles' even more.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's not funny. In fact, it's just embarrassing.NOT RECOMMENDED.
__label__2 HE'S HUNG!: You know you really have to give this guy a lot of credit. His voice sounds like one of the really bad guys singing in the local karaoke bar. BUT...he's selling records doing it! He's got more guts than anyone I know because he knows what some people think of his voice and he doesn't have a problem with it. He loves it!
__label__2 tight: i'm surprised that no one has reviewed this album anyway this cd is great. For those of you that like break beat music and bass this album is awesome not the best but definetly worth buying
__label__2 This is Florida Breaks: This cd is one of the backbone sets to the "Florida Breaks" sub-genre. I believe this to be the height of Rob-E's mixing talent.
__label__2 Great Crunch: Udi's has great crunch and flavor. Love the macadamia and dried pineapple addition. It could use a few more of each of these, as they seem to pour out in the first few bowlfuls, and then you are left with none.
__label__1 This CD is full of pathetic screaming and bad lyrics: This CD sucks. Why are these stupid bands dissing the US? If they dont like it then get out! NoFX, Anti-Flag, and Nothingface all suck and have no idea on politics. I hate them and never will like them. I heard Ether on Uranium and was like "These dudes are soft...and they suck!" I listened to the other songs and they arent really soft but his screams are horrible. Listen to 40 Below Summer they kinda resemble Nothingface but are 50 times better. Dont support these anti-US losers.
__label__1 waste of money !: About 20 bands in the US, like this one, sound exactly the same!Skeleton's only great song is "Murder Is [wanking]", everything else is mediocre. Save the money for something else, cuz this one here ain't worth it! I recommend: Slipknot, Disturbed, System Of A Down, Static X, Mudvayne and Sepultura
__label__2 A different approach: I think this step was a progression from Violence in the direction of creating more melodic music. In some cases, like Ether and Beneath, it worked. On others, it fell flat.Nothingface has always done best with songs that vary their tempo (see Breathe Out from Audio Guide or For All the Sin from Violence). In that regards, Machination works well, but not as well. Then they have their HEAVY stuff, which is certainly heavy (I Wish I was a Communist, Here Come the Butchers), but some of it seems kinda there. The standout tracks on the album are Ether, All Cut Up, and Murder Are Masturbation. However, 3 songs don't make an album great. There is a bit of filler in there that kinda takes away from it.Hopefully Nothingface's label problems will motivate them to go back to making music like Everyday Atrocity.
__label__1 Disappointed: I was very excited to find this Chucky Set my son has been wanting one for a while. But upon receiving my package and viewing it I was very disappointed. My son planned on collecting them never opening it, and the packaging is damaged and ripped on the box that holds the dolls.
__label__2 I'm glad I happened on this product by accident: I found this when I was looking for a canister that would coordinate with my kitchen. This is great. I don't fix coffee every day at home but really enjoy my fresh weekend coffee. This keeps the coffee fresh for the longer period that it takes me to use a full bag. It has worked as I expected. It is battery-powered (4 AA) which makes it really more versatile. I would recommend this product.
__label__1 never worked: Since I received the product it never worked.Very disappointed!!!Don' t know what to do as I don't live in the USA!!!
__label__2 Comedy Rap with A Twist: My Brother Blockhead along with his pal Jar. have put together a fun and not at all serious piece of work. For those of you who like a little Comedy with your rap you will love this album. Ithink Blockhead and Jer. are at there best when doing full tracks and not skits. The best being Back In Da Dayz Witch if the labal is smart will clean up and put out to radio. It has smash all over it. Anyway If your in the mood for a laugh and are a rap fan and you want something a little differant this is for you. Being a member of the family my congrats. goes to Blockhead (my brother) and Jer. on a job well done! I only wish more rapers wouldn't takes themeseles so seriously.
__label__1 WISH I WOULD HAVE PASSED ON THIS ONE: I bought this CD knowing I probably wouldn't like it, and I like it less than I thought I would. Half of this album contains stupid skits, and the songs just aren't very funny. The novelty wears off after the 1st couple of listens, the highlights of the album in my opinion are the 3 that Blockhead produced, "Beer", "Back in Da Daiz", and "Chapstick"(which is only like 40 seconds long). As MURS says, opinions are like rap careers, everybody's got one, but I honestly think the average 11 year old would find this CD a little childish.
__label__2 Rita Mulcahy's PMP Exam Prep turned on some lights: Rita's book is candid and straight forward. The book was a great compliment to the PMBOK giving hints, tricks, and great practice tests. I studied the PMBOK first then used Rita's book to round out my knowledge. I only took 2 hours 15 minutes out of 4 hours to take the test and passed.
__label__1 Highly overrated: This book does present some material well. But it is more of an advertising teaser so you'll buy the whole kaboodle paying several hundred dollars. Or worse you'll be motivated to take her course paying thousands of dollars.PMP exam prep has definitely been a growing industry. The certification is by itself overly hyped up. Sometimes it all seems like a scam. One can pass PMP by just reading a bunch of prep books. Just because someone is a PMP doesn't mean a squat.
__label__2 Truly an "Exam Prep" book: This book is a must for those preparing for the PMP exam. I bought this book after researching (including book reviews like this one) a lot of books. I think this one stood out for me to buy. I am really pleased with the content and alignment of this book.I also purchased the PMP FASTRACK simulation software from RMC. That software really iced the cake! My confidence level went up 147.5% (Ok, I was checking if you are really reading this!). My confidence level went up significantly and I was completely prepared. I passed the PMP with a whopping 80%. I don't think I could have passed without the simulation software.Good Luck to all you "Soon to be PMPs".
__label__2 Excellent Study Guide: I think this book is a must for anyone taking the test. It should not be your only source, but recommend using this as your primary study material for the 2 weeks leading up to the test. Her practice exam questions are very similar (in nature) to the actual test.
__label__2 Recommended for your listening pleasure: Just saw them live from the moshpit at the House of Blues in L.A. after listening to this import CD for a while. A really good, heavy 3-piece band with a good future ahead of them. A CD you can listen to start to finish without skipping tracks.
__label__2 Wonder what's next? Answer: more killer music by Chevelle: This is Chevelle's fourth album and they are not slowing down at all. I would rank this as their second best record behind Wonder What's Next. It will be hard to beat that one. But they come close on this. They have a thick, chunky sound that can be thunderous at times, and it sounds great with a good subwoofer. The singer really sounds a lot like Maynard from Tool at times, but that is a good thing. Musically, they sound nothing like Tool, though. These guys are one of the best hard rock bands around, and they never let me down. They are on the heavier end of the hard rock spectrum, just so you know.
__label__2 Needed a break...: So, rather than write a lengthy and seemingly insightful bunch of S**T, im just going to say that this album did not impress me at the first few listens. I put it down in disappointment for a few months. I then put it back in the player for a spin and I was greatly surprised. Its not Wonder and its not Point #1 but in its own right its still a good album. Grab it.
__label__1 nice idea but doesn't work - save your time and your money: I bought this to use in teaching at the university. I installed the software and found that the device didn't work. I called technical service at Seiko but apparently this item was discontinued several years ago. A nice gentleman attempted to help me but it was clear that he had never seen or setup or used the device. I was on the line with him quite a while and apparently his supervisor felt enough was enough so I was told to try something and call back if I had problems. I was disgusted with Seiko and contacted my seller and requested a refund. He was very nice about it, credited me that day, and didn't even want the device back.Bottom-line: don't waste your money - Seiko gave up on it ages ago and they don't support it.
__label__1 Nonplussed.: This product does everything advertised. I just wish it came with functional recognition software. It's not enough to be able to e-mail jpgs of my notes to someone else; I need my notes reliably converted into text.As another reviewer so eloquently put it, this is nothing that can't be accomplished with a crayon and a scanner. The "Ooh and Ahh" factor of watching one's handwriting pop up on the screen isn't worth $.If you want a way to get pictures of your handwriting from point A to point B, stick with your fax machine for now.
__label__2 Sugar+Crack+Euphoria=Hardwired: Both CD's contain the best in breakbeat\happyhardcore that Scott Brown has to offer. The best song, in my opinion, is his cover of Gigi D'Agostino's "I'll Fly With You" Quite simply the best song on Disc 1. There is also a remix of Scott Browns Elysium, THE song that got me hooked on his music. If you have any of the Happy2BHardcore albums, or Scott Browns previous releases, then this album will not disappoint. If your new to happy hardcore, this album will treat your ears to one of the most hyper sub-genres of techno. The first disc seems to go darker towards the end, but other than that, no complaints. All around it's an awesome CD.
__label__2 perfect for my friend: I was glad to get this for my friend. It came quickly and I was pleased with the service. Thanks
__label__2 The State of Northeast Hardcore: This is the best comp I have! I like almost all the bands alot, even though I hadn't heard many of them. The artwork is intense and well done and the production for a comp is really consistent. Standouts - Beyond Reason (I am sleeping with the bass playa), Compression, Proof of Purchase (three girls and one lucky guy). A must buy - 5 stars.
__label__1 Not a great stove: I am not happy with my Bosch gas free-standing convection range. One burner keeps clicking after I turn it off. This forces me to disconnect the stove. I just had it fixed for $200 a couple of months ago and now it is broken again. My advice: don't buy one!
__label__2 Smaller than I expected: Although the dimensions say 11.9 x 7.8 x 8.1 inches, the dimensions of the actual plastic tank (not including the cover) are 11 x 6.5 x 6 inches. This is equal to 1.85 gallons. I was expecting a tank that could hold around 3 gallons because I foolishly used the dimensions listed here. I noticed that my tank could hold less than 2 gallons when I was doing a water change and noticed I had only siphoned out 1 gallon of water and the water level was under the halfway point in the tank. Other than that this is a pretty good tank if used temporarily for a sick fish, like I am doing.
__label__1 Waste of Time!: Overall the story was okay-it at least kept me interested until the end-only because I was expecting some of my questions (which kept me reading) to be answered. I am more confused now than when I started reading it. I understand that there is a sequel on the way, but I wont read it because I didn't care about the characters and a sequel seems like overkill-she could have easily ended the book.Also, her dialogue is lacking and unbelieveable, and she uses a very irritating form of third person writing. She also needs a decent editor because I am a teacher and I had an overwhelming urge to get out my "red pen" and correct the grammatical and spelling errors myself.Don't waste your time.
__label__2 Testify: Darn it! Is it me, or does Rage Against the Machine put out the best singles? I have Battle of LA, and I like Testify and Guerillia Radio. I can only imagine how much money Rage rakes in with these awsome singles. I wish they would just make longer, limited Ep's or something. This is awsome, but Rage should take example of Incubus and make a limited, worthy Ep.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP: I bought this item in May of 2012 and here it is February 2013 and it has died on me. It was originally bought to replace the factory frayed cord which still works but I wanted to be on the safe side and not fry my laptop. I have since purchased an original from HP. It may cost more but at least it will work for years as opposed to much less. Read the reviews and you won't be sorry.
__label__1 Not a Genuine HP Product.: Like others have said on here before this is NOT an HP product. It is a cheap knock off.It is better as it has an LED indicator but other than that it was much worse then my HP Original charger. This charger got much hotter then a true HP charger which indicates to me that it is not as efficient from taking AC to DC conversion very well.Wish chargers would have the 80 Plus standard that most desktops have but they don't. If they did than 80 Plus certified products wouldn't be as warm and you use less energy! I digress...Bottom line: Has an LED indicator. It chargers up your battery but it will get much hotter then a genuine HP product. It may not last as long as a real charger but I have not tested that out.
__label__2 never received: I finally went to Hallmark and bought it there - it was a gift for my mother - but I read it first and it's a very dear little book.
__label__1 not very inspiring.: i started reading this book and it so filled with a mishmash of junk, i gave it to the local library for its book sale.
__label__2 A Golden book: Not as good as the earlier books in the series but still very enjoyable. In the last couple of Peabody books, the characters were getting stale. In the Tomb of the Golden Bird, they come back to life so that you want to know more about them and what is going on in their lives. Like a long awaited letter from an old friend. (Although the Master Criminal is not developing to be the strong character I had hoped for.) With Peters historical discription of Egypt, you can easily imagine what life was like back then. This sounds trite but it is always one of the more enjoyable aspects of a Peter's book. So, why not five stars? The mystery, what there was of it, was weak. Almost like an after thought. I love the other non peabody mysteries. Maybe it is time for Ms Peters to take a break from the Emersons.
__label__1 I'm a fan, but this book was disappointing!: Not up to the usual standard, it was slow moving and bogged down a number of times....at the end you wondered what was the point? It lacked plot interest, it just meandered through the story and a lot of plot tie-ins from previous books were not well done. I love the series, but this was a poor effort compared to the others.
__label__2 18th entry in series another delight: Tomb of the Golden Bird by Elizabeth Peters is the 18th, and possibly last, book in her fabulous Amelia Peabody series. The entire Emerson clan is back in Egypt for Howard Carter's discovery (with some guidance from Emerson of course) of Tutankhamon's tomb. Emerson peeves off Lord Carnavon, and the entire family is then banned from the most wondrous find in all of Egyptology's history. In the midst of this uproar, Sethos has returned with news of a possible conspiracy to bring down the shaky peace that has settled across the Middle East since the end of the Great War. The plot, as usual, is irrelevant. What matters is the snappy repartee, the always delightful Amelia sticking her nose into everyone's business, and of course a pair of star-crossed lovers. It's standard Peters' stuff, but she makes it look elegant and easy. I do hope this isn't the end!
__label__1 Disappointing: I have read every book in the Amelia Peabody series and was anxiously awaiting this one. The first three-quarters appeared to be painfully written. It wasn't until the last sixth of the book that the quintessential Peters writing style emerged. Given the interwoven tale with the historical events, it could have been more in line with other Peabody novels.
__label__1 Not exceptional: Given the reputation of the author - this is the first novel by Salvatore I read - I expected a lot more."The Cleric Quintet" is at best average-quality, mass-production fantasy writing, full of cliches, one-dimensioned characters and with a predictable storyline that might be good for a RPG session but is definitely too simple-minded for a novel (series).While I have read worse, I would not buy the book again and am thinking hard whether it is worth giving the Drizzt novels a try...
__label__2 Rolf Wallet: Thank you, for some reason I like this particular wallet and none others. No stores seem to carry it any longer.
__label__2 Culture and Conduct: It was required by my Intro to Anthropology professor, but I found it to be a necessary evil. I enjoyed many of its stories, but it wasn't overly gripping (bear in mind, it served as a text). It had the necessary vocabulary and terms needed to further our understanding in class, and to contribute in discussions, so not bad overall.
__label__1 Terrible quality, dangerous product. Do NOT buy!: I originally bought this as a second mic for my daughter's karaoke machine. Barely a month after purchase, the plastic coating around the wires at the base separated from the base itself, exposing the electrical wires. (I will try to include a picture). I assumed my kids had done something to it and ordered another because it seemed like a decent price for what we wanted. This time, however, we've been extremely careful, and it's only been used under my supervision, and not used that often. It took maybe two months, but it happened again. I just feel fortunate that I noticed it before my kids used it so they didn't electrocute themselves. This product shouldn't even be sold. I am disgusted. I would give it no stars if that were an option.
__label__1 bad cable: good device, good cable. BUT TOGETHER DOES NOT MATCH.. TOTAL.. WORTHLESS PRODUCT BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD .. PAID MY MONEY FOR A PIECE OF GARBAGE..
__label__2 Excelent Tropical Plant Source Book: We are new gardeners in the Caribbean. This book is an excellent source book for us as we increase the size and sensory effects of our garden.
__label__2 Tolerable: I have a small dog and after the recent teeth cleaning by our vet to the tune of $400 I figured any attempt to clean teeth would be better than nothing. I've always brushed my dogs teeth so I was disappointed that I wasn't doing enough to keep the tarter at bay. This oral rinse is very different and a bit challenging to use at first. My dog wasn't too keen on the long plastic tube and I've figured out that it's best to have the liquid nearly to the tip of the tube before inserting it in my dogs mouth. If I don't have the liquid in the tube the amount of air blowing in my dogs mouth leads her to shy away from it. All it takes is a quick squeeze on either side of the dogs mouth and you're done! My dog doesn't seem to be bothered by the taste if there is one. Overall I'm hoping that this well help keep my dogs teeth cleaner but I won't really know until next year.
__label__1 Required Text: This is a required text at my school, but after having read the first 5 chapters there is almost nothing of value that I have read. I have spoken to several people that have used this text for the class in prior semesters and they told me that they had stopped reading it after the first several chapters also.
__label__1 kindle version: I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in the Kindle version of this book.I just bought my Kindle and there are a considerable amount of mispelledwords. The book however is a great book but I would advise reframing from purchasing the kindle version.
__label__2 he will enjoy this: a small project, and legos are way overpriced, but grandson likes it because it has figure of a person which he uses a lot, he makes many interesting 'things' by mixing these pieces with other sets
__label__1 Do not use WMP11 with HP Pavilion: After wasting an *enormous* amount of time (over a week), I found that the Linksys WMP11 causes my HP Pavilion with AMD CPU to freeze hard and neither HP nor Linksys were able to resolve. I even tried returning the WMP11 for a replacement in case it was bad, but the replacement did exactly the same thing. I just changed to a TRENDnet TEW-228PI wireless PCI card that works great! The problem with the WMP11 was complicated to diagnose because it connected fine. If no data was transferred, no problem. But once you start transferring data thru the WMP11, it would crash (hard freeze) the system within a small random interval (2-5 minutes). Buyer beware.
__label__2 linksys wreless B PCI card: the item came earlier than expected, was easy to install and works great. it is not compatible with windows 7 unfortunately which i did not know but works fine with windows xp.
__label__1 Flies like a rock: You'll get lots of exercise running after this so called kite because all it does is crash.
__label__1 Ready to Crash Airplane: The kite utterly sucks. I had a old airplane kite that I had flown off the back of a bike crashed an excess of 30 times and all I had to do was duct tape some places up and it would fly like new. It flew much better than this kite by far! This kite crashes everytime you can see it is inevitable just by how it flys the wind ends have no support so they are just folding in as it flys causing rolls. The propellor works but is incredibly cheap because all the blades are pointing in different directions. There is also a cockpit rod that must be pushed in to expand the top. The rod needs to be pushed in and held in place by a velcro strap that basically comes out every time the plane crashes a.k.a everytime. This kite is a joke it says ready to fly in seconds. It took me and my friend a good 5 minutes because the pictures were very unclear in the end we assumed how to assemble it and tried different configurations but all ended up you guessed it CRASHING.
__label__1 Beware of incompatibility problems: Unable to install, the product was not compatible with my computer system.
__label__2 Best in its field.: Invaluable for any would be sociologist or anyone else interested in socio-criminolgy or deviance or statistics. Both authors display incredible method, intelligence, and craft. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and it was assigned!
__label__1 Turn up the volume: Purchased these headphones for my son to use with his portable CD/MP3 player. The sound was ok but the headphones are not very efficiant. To hear enough sound, you had to turn the volume all the way up. Even with the volume up high, the headphones just did not deliver.
__label__2 The Best DVD Burner On The Market!: Came as a Pioneer drive in retail box.Took about 5mins to install under WinXP.Burns DVD-R at 2X(great feature).DVD-R blanks are also dropping in price daily.For the price it is a good buy.
__label__1 okay keyboard cleaner: This is an okay keyboard cleaner. But same thing could be done with a box of Q-tips and some alcohol for under a dollar. This item is way overpriced for what it does.update 5/24/2012I am changing my rating to 2 stars. This item is overpriced useless junk. Fortunately Amazon's refund policy allowed me to get a full refund.
__label__2 Amazing Prequel!!: This book is a great prequel to the Dragonlance Chronicles. It relays the story of the power-hungry mage, Raistlin, and his muscle-bound brother, Caramon. Raistlin starts out as a child, and grows to be in his early 20's when he takes The Test at the Tower of Wayreth.I think this is an amazing book, and recommend it to anyone who has read the Dragonlance Chronicles. Margaret Weis does a great job of keeping the reader in suspense and giving great background information on the group that was in the Dragonlance Chronicles. Brothers In Arms is the sequel to this book. BUY THEM BOTH NOW!!!
__label__2 Excellent: Really good to read after you've read Chronicles because you just HAVE to know more about Raistlin!
__label__2 Its great, It really answers my questions about Raistlin.: You wouldn't beleive the kind of life this powerful magi has gone through!! This story depicts the losses, wins, pain, and love that has happened through his life. I guarantee that you will like it.
__label__2 A great insight into Raistlin Majere's past: A wonderful story that will satisfy anyone looking to know the background of "The Sly One".Without ruining the story, or spoiling the plot, this book details Raistlin's youth and Test at the Tower of the Magi. This book reveals as much of Raistlin's sensitive side, as it does his abrasive side.I would recommend reading the Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy (Dragons of [insert season] [insert adjective]) and the entire "Twins" trilogy before reading this book, because there are some slight contradictions that are cleared up in this novel.
__label__2 High quality: This product works exactly as intended. Opens doors, open and close windows and honks horn. A little childish but fun, works as it should.
__label__2 Ms. A. Jolie is an amazing stunt-woman: Great DVD. Worth getting.I can't believe Angelina Jolie does her own stunts. Looking at the extra features is a real eye-opener - what do they save for the stunt crew? The semi-lethal stuff?
__label__1 Don't waste your money: This movie plot is extremely predictable, even by action movie standards. I am still trying to figure out how Angelina Jolie keeps getting selected for these roles. If you have seen Tomb Raider or Mr. and Mrs. Smith or Wanted then you have already seen this movie at least once. Move on.
__label__1 Wow, it was bad.: I can't believe I made it all the way through the DVD without turning it off. It is horrible. The story is incredibly predictable, the "action" is about as realistic as Star Wars and I can't believe I am going to say this, Jolie looks too skinny and not nearly as attractive as she usually does. Do yourself a favor and save you money for something else, this one is a stinker!
__label__2 Salt - DVD: Very high in adventure and a good ending, very happy. I believe that this is one of Angelina Jolie better action movies. Another great mystery movie of hers is The Tourist.
__label__2 Salt DVD: New DVD delivered with alternate endings and special features. For some reason would not play on my Pioneer combo recorder / player. Some pixelation on my Samsung player, worked fine on the Sony DVD player. The movie is action and suspensse, well acted, and the action sequences are out-standing. You'll want to watch this one more than once.The DVD was shipped and delivered very quickly.
__label__1 Salt: At this point questioning whether I make any further purchases on Amazon, because of Moral Hazard!The DVD Salt was sent to me, it was blank, there was nothing on the DVD.Sent numerous email's, I have not received a reply! Nor a Refund! Nor a new movie!So, at this point questioning whether this system actually has any purpose!At the point I will no longer put my information on the site and considering withdrawing all together!
__label__2 It was good. Some scenes alittle silly like.: It was overall a good movie. Only downside for me was how she moved around and got away so easily. Jumping from truck to truck and the other things she pulled off in my mind would never happen. Otherwise, it's a movie worth seeing.
__label__2 great movie: angeline plays a great female action heroine this movie. hopefully they can make more of these. great visuals, quality of the movie, and overall a good action flick.
__label__1 What kind of ending is that?: After all the excitement full of twists & turns it ends flat. They don't even finish it. It's like there will be a continuation; a part 2. The lack of ending ruined it for me.
__label__1 Mr. Bourne, you've got a lovely daughter...: Girls as tough as you are something rare... Or perhaps the song should be "For she's a Jolie good fellow". Angelina Jolie as Jack Bauer/Jason Bourne, leaping tall buildings with a single bound (almost), beating the stuffing out of numerous assailants, performing near-miracles on command through a particularly ridiculous plot. Ultimately such films are merely flimsy vehicles for the numerous high-energy chase/fight scenes, and as such I find them ultimately unsatisfying (except for the Bourne films - I found that Matt Damon was able to breathe life into Jason Bourne much more than Angelina was with Evelyn Salt).So, it comes down to taste. If you like things where the hero(ine) kicks the living daylights out of a series of baddies at regular intervals and can ignore the flimsy plot that allegedly connects these individual instances of utter mayhem, this is for you. If, however, you like a plot that makes some sort of sense in the real world, it isn't.
__label__1 Salt: Had to return the DVD as it was not compatible for the United States. Had I realized that I never would have ordered it.
__label__2 Good old spy flick...: As another reviewer stated, if you like a good spy flick, you should like this. There is the constant, "is she, or isn't she?" question which always makes for a good suspense film. I was pretty impressed with the DC scenes (as I live here). It was a pretty good mix of real scenes and some staged sets. All in all, a good film.That said, the whole "video on demand" concept needs to ramp up the picture quality to full-screen and not a dumbed-down version of 16:9. The sound quality could be better. Still no Closed-Caption which I really need. If you want quality and features then go with Blu-Ray. If you want convenience with the downloading, then video-on-demand is the way to go.
__label__1 IT Stinks: I had this card put in my hp that has windows xp and it stinks. I play everquest and it is blocky ,flickers and now I cannot even play it. I tried down loading new drivers and all that did was make me have to reboot. I totaLLY THINK THIS CARD IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
__label__1 How did this album get to product?: One word and one word only - crap.All this guy does it say bad words in a song. Say nonsense and nonsense over and over again. I have no idea why some people like this guy.Just save your money, save your time, save your ears, and do not buy this album.
__label__1 BOOOOORING!!: I have read almost every book written by Lori Wick and I think her latest ones are just not that great. This book leads you to believe it is a romance set in the South Pacific and will take place during the war. The plot actually had tremendous potential. Well, the bulk of the book is set in California with one of the "lead" characters (the Navy man) absent from every chapter for about half the story. I could care less about girls shopping and altering clothing or the arrival of a pet kitten. There are three main things wrong with this book: 1. Boring. 2. Boring. 3. Boring. I realize all three points are the same but it is such an important one I feel I must repeat it. I look for books that I can't put down. I had a very difficult time even wanting to pick this one up. I think Ms. Wick should take a break from writing until she can weave a yarn as great as her earlier works. You'd be better off reading some of those.
__label__1 I couldn't finish it...: Usually I love Wick's books and have sincerly enjoyed her tuckermills books and have read all of her other novels, enjoying Pretence and others the most, but this book was terribly hard to get into. I actually couldn't finish it and gave it to my husband to trade for commentaries (He's a seminary student). I was really disappointed, because when I learned Wick had written a WWII novel I was excited, but my excitement was misplaced.
__label__1 Lori Wick: I can't stand Lori Wick books. I used to love them until I realized that real people are nothing like her characters. All the women are gorgeous, all the men are handsome, caring, and wonderful. THERE ARE NO REAL MEN OR ANYBODY LIKE THAT! Her books are just fairy tales that would never come true in real life and I don't plan on wasting any more of my time reading that garbage.
__label__1 but not the record company: Though the song is a strong one, and the photo of Morrissey as a priest is hilarious, the thought of spending this kind of money for two songs is far more blasphemous than anything.You are the quarry, indeed.
__label__2 A super talent: I was lucky enough to see eric martin play in the San Francisco Bay Area a few weeks ago. His voice is as strong as ever and does the ablum even greater justice. Why do they only give us five stars to choose?
__label__1 Buyer Beware, Not as Advertised!!!!: Please do not purchase based on the dimensions Sabrina Silver advertises. They are NOT 10mm wide and are a lot closer to 3mm (all other dimensions are correct). I had contacted the seller numerous times but they refuse to change this information and will not refund my shipping costs even though the product is misrepresented and the pair I had received had a hinge (not the post) that was defective (hinge was not filed and very sharp to point where you could pop a balloon with it). I was looking for a very small but wide huggie earring and going by the dimensions thought this was the pair I had been searching for, it was not. For anyone looking for a wide silver huggie earring, Stuller makes a great quality product and worth the extra $$. I will never do business with a company that thinks you are NOT entitled to a full refund for a misrepresented, damaged product that they send you.
__label__2 Orginal Problems fixed for nice product.: I recieved this drive at the beginning of March. After a week, I started having trouble with the drive door... it would not stay shut!! The Cendyne repackaged Verbatim I was told was really a Verbatim repackaged Lite-on. After some tricky dos firmware work, I relabeled the drive, loaded the lite-on firmware update and it works like a charm! Love it. got it here cheap...
__label__1 horrible: I read this book while on a trip to Africa. I actively search out fast paced books with at least one intelligent character and a compelling theme. The reviewers (back cover) seemd to support my thought that this book was worth a read. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed: slow start, poorly developed characters, an "intelligent character" that was anything but, an author character with zero writing skills, confusing mid-section, and a drink of water for an ending. I was so disappointed with the book that I actually left it on British Airways backseat pocket and hadwrote a note to the next reader: "don't waste your time".The only thing that is actually a mistery about the book is why a few people rieks their names and reputations talking it up. Total lies.Finally, this is the very first time, I've ever written a review about a book. Normally, I won't waste my time. However, in this case, I felt obligated to warn potnetial future readers.Don't read. You will be gravely disappointed.
__label__1 Ridiculous: I did not believe one word of this story. The main character, a woman, is completely unbelievable. I felt no suspense at any point. Near the end, when she keeps asking "Where is [a major unseen character]?" and [the person she's asking] does nothing but change the subject, she has no clue whereas the reader feels hit over the head with the obvious. If you want real suspense, read Thomas Perry.
__label__1 not convincing as it proceeds: This novel starts out okay, with a likable, pretty heroin in an unusual situation, and good writing too--but the second half of the book is a far reach, way beyond what can be convincing. The key bit that has her haul around a long, heavy extension ladder and then climb it to the third-story window of a hospital with a two-foot bolt cutter tucked in her belt would be a feat worthy of Wonder Woman. Then to expect the bad guy to come to a desolate meeting point alone and unarmed is the height of naivety. And those are just examples of why I became so disappointed in what promised to be a good read.
__label__2 In your FACE, left-wing slumlords!: Well, here you have it. One of your own (Dennis Miller being another darling of the left who has awakened post-911) leaving the reservation. My hope is that the left will just continue their weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, as their database dwindles, and moves inexorably to the well-deserved "ash heap of history". Get used to it, chumps...there's NOTHING you can do to stop it. Oh, and in your predictable anti-First Amendment fashion, DO try to quash my comments, because they make you (yes, they do) weep, wail and gnash your teeth, right? Good.
__label__2 Great resource for ayurveda!: Excellent book, It gives the energetics characteristics and recommended usage for lots of herbs, both eastern and western. An incredible resource for anyone interested in ayurveda. Also it is well written and simple, so it suits the novice and expert alike.
__label__2 A Survey both Wide and Deep: Hello:About a month ago I submitted a review of this book, but apparently you rejected it, for it has never appeared. Can you tell me why? It was four-stars, and a generally favorable review, reflecting my rather good opinion of it, and seeming to me acceptable, especially since there is only one other customer review on record.Please let me hear from you. Thanks.
__label__2 This should be the bible of dog training.: This book is eye opening, gives the dog a lot of credit for figuring things out on his own, in my mind turns out the author is justified. Very satisfied, opened up my eyes on giving the pup a lot more leeway. After 8mo. I can say the system is sound, I used it on a rescue pup with some trust issues and at 1 1/2 yrs, 8 of those months with us, he had himself an awesome season. Started out a little slow, but as he went he learn, then he had one day where he just broke out and never looked back. Very satisfying to see where he came from, to where he is, I am convinced he would not have responded to heavy handed training.
__label__2 First-time gun dog owner review: I enjoyed reading the book in preparation for the arrival of my first gun dog pup. Though personally inexperienced in training, I have hunted over friends' dogs for several years and have spent enough time with "dog people" to have a sense of what can work. This book presents an excellent overview for the first-time or experienced trainer.
__label__2 A great read for ANY dog owner!: Joan's book certainly helped me when I became the new owner of a hunting dog eight years ago. The book focuses on the time period before the arrival of the puppy, through the first critical year of a dog's life. The information in this book would be useful for any new dog owner, whether the dog is a hunting breed or not. I would say this is a MUST read for anyone who plans on hunting over their dog. I know that when it is time for the next puppy in a year or two, I will be reading this book again! Highly recommended!
__label__1 Always reads low, here: We always get temperature readings below 98.6 degrees when reading people without fevers. First time I tried the screen read 94.6 degrees F. And, the readings seem to vary quite a bit. Also, the instructions say you are supposed to send the unit back to Mabis every (was it two) years? for re-calibration at a cost of about $15.Maybe I don't know how to use it; but, we were quite disappointed.
__label__1 Not worth the money!!!: 1) Item looks better on screen than in your hands.2) When you first turn on the thermometer LCD screen says, "Lo" for Low battery.3) No off button, to conserve battery power.4) Temperature is instantaneous but inconsistent, especially if taken in one ear and then the next, usually off by a whole degree. It's far worse when taken simultaneously. You get different results every time.5) Unreliable. Inconsistent. Not worth the money. Bad choice.
__label__2 Good thermometer, easy to use: This is a good thermometer, easy to use. It makes a noise when it's done reading your temperature, which makes it easy to take your own. I also like that you don't have to use any disposable parts, which is sanitary enough if you're using it just on your family.
__label__1 3-M monitor review purchased at Amazon.com: This was much much larger than I needed or wanted. It was way too big. I wanted something about 1/2 that size.
__label__2 TV stand: Bought this to use as a TV stand on a table on our screened porch. Works great and is exactly what we needed to use during any kind of weather.
__label__1 Way massive, thin material.: I ordered one size up and these were so large they stretched several inches below my foot. I'm going to have to cuff and hem them. (I'm 5'4" , wear 14-16 and never have this problem with length in XL.)Also, what's up with the crappy thin material? Like cheap pajama bottoms. I had a pair of these from several years back and the material was quality fleece, lasted very well. With these I don't expect more than a season or two out of them. I wouldn't wear my actual size because they aren't flattering and show every lump and bump, but a size up and they drape a bit and provide at least some modesty.I'm not going to return them because they will *work* under a big shirt and I'm not finding anything better out there. But this is really the last clothing I buy from Russell.
__label__1 Very ,very thin material: These pants are light and comfortable, but the material is very, very thin - just about see-thru thin. The fabric may hold up well, but I'm not planning on wearing these out of the house, the material is just too sheer for me to feel comfortable in public with them. The pants I got are the oxford color, which is not 100% cotton, so other colors might not be as bad. These do have a very polyester feel.
__label__2 Greatness: I had no problem with these sweatpants. Even as I washed in dried them they did not shrink. They are true to fit.
__label__1 Kinda sucks to play - but has nice special effects unseen in any other game: I think it's about time gamers DEMANDED their games have spectacular new special effects AND be fun to play.This game was not fun to play.I would rather fast forward through a video of someone else completing the game just so I could see the special effects and design, and not have to hack out hour after hour of horrible game play.This design team was just chosen to do the next gen design for a upcoming Jedi title- it had better be FUN as well as DEVASTATINGLY BEAUTIFUL.
__label__1 Door Problem: I purchased a Black and Decker TRO 2000 Toast-R-Oven just a month ago and it works OK. However, because the handle is so big or the toaster is so low I could not get the door to stay open to get my toast out. The handle hits the counter top and will flip back to close. I had to cut a 1/2 board to put the toaster on so the door would stay open. If you buy this product get it from a store you can take it back to if your toaster door don't stay open.
__label__1 Product might be good, but I received duds: After many years of receiving good products through Amazon, this one was, sorry to say, a dud. twice. The first Toast-r-Oven was received with the knob assembly and chrome behind it pulled away from the body of the toaster. Amazon very quickly sent a replacement but this one had the toaster button stuck in the 'in' position. Toasted a piece of bread to see if the button would come 'out' but it didn't. We're returning this one too. The toast was nicely browned though, so if you get a good one, keep it!...
__label__1 Toaster switch defective: Within 6 mos the toaster switch broke. After reading other people's reviews it seems that this is a common defect. Also haven't had any luck using it to cook other foods. Only good for toasting. Recommend staying away from this brand. You'll end up paying more in long run to replace it with another one. Buy better brand/quality to begin with. I learned my lesson!
__label__1 Bad luck with B&D: I had one many moons ago. It was a piece of junk. It wouldn't toast correctly or consistently and it wouldn't broil correctly. On the other hand it did last for at least 12 years. Right up until the day I took a shotgun to it (after buying a DeLonghi .... but that's another story).
__label__1 Stay away from Black and Decker: I have bought many B&D toaster ovens over the years. However, in the last 4 years, the quality has gone seriously downhill. Screws are missing, toasting is erratic and uneven.The finish is peeling off. My daughter had to return two new ones within two weeks. I am about to buy a Cuisinart. B&D is an abomination!!
__label__2 Easy read - lives up to title: I'm sort of cheating on this one; since Thane works for me I get to see the book way before y'all do! It will actually publish at 500 pages or so due to the great depth to which he goes into each topic. In spite of the length, it goes quickly.I like his approach, with lots of examples, and his use of the most current COBOL standards, combined with 15 years of business experience on mainframes and PCs. His advice makes sense, works, and can be easily expanded upon. Even though I've been writing COBOL for 30 years, I learned some ways to improve my program structure.I evaluated the book with the idea of using it as a text for a 4 credit hour Freshman or Sophomore class in compter science and found that it should do nicely, in fact the proposal is on the Dean's desk right now, with a request for Spring 1999 semester introduction.
__label__2 Decent album for Stevie B fans: I finally got a copy of this used after looking for it for years. I wasn't sure what to expect but after a few listens, I say this album has some hidden gems.For freestyle fans, the lead track "Since You've Been Gone Away" and "You Are The One" are good tracks that don't recycle that often used "Planet Rock" beat.If you like slow jams, "I Love My Love Today" and "Give Me Just a Little More Time" are the ones to go for.The rest of the album is ok. WHile I like "Can You Hear Me Now" and "It's So Good", I noticed that they both seemed to be using the same beat with different lyrics which was a little disappointing. The other songs depend on your tastes. I didn't hate any of them which is probably the best news.This album probably won't convert anyone who wasn't a Stevie B fan before. However, for any fans who like his stuff, it's worth tracking down.
__label__2 Hummingingbirds: This is one great book!I resentley had to do a report on hummingbirds. I looked in many books,but none of them seemed to have the information I needed to know.Then I found this book, it's full of great information on hummingbirds. I found out every thing I needed to know.( I got A+ on my report)You have to read this book!
__label__1 A Glorified USA Today Accounting of a Terrorist Network: If you pay attention to the news, read newspapers and/or news magazines then this book will add little to your existing understanding of this group. The book does a very good job of detailing the minutia of the al-Qaida membership. Inasmuch as the membership list is important, maybe to the CIA, the minutia was a lost effort because most of the membership biographies were very short and cryptic at best. I bought the book expecting that it would articulate the group's activity, financiers, State sponsors, directions, goals and ideological underpinnings. The title lead me to that conclusion. The book does not do this and for that reason I was dissapointed.The only high point of the book, for me, was the re-print of bin Laden's speeches. Pass on this book.
__label__2 Works great!: Had a hard time reaching the bleeder screw on my 2005 Ford F150. Not anymore, works and fits great with my vehicle.
__label__2 Indo-dance supreme: Graduates of MP3.com, NatarajXT, on the recently formed NuTone label (subsidiary of Canada's Nettwerk), put on a great show, mixing the traditional Indian sarod, sitar, and esraj with electronics to produce a series of tracks that vibrate, pulse, flow, and move in perfect East-West fusion.Nataraj is one of the names (and incarnations) of Shiva, from the Hindu pantheon (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva). While Shiva is often referred to as the Destroyer, in his Nataraj form he is Lord of the Dance, and these guys sure do a terrific job of paying homage to their namesake. One of the most popular musical cultures to be associated with worldbeat/world fusion, Indian music can just as easily be diluted and considerably weakened as it can be hugely enhanced.Because they're sharp guys, NatarajXT knows this, and they reflect that knowledge in their music. This is one of the better examples of Indian-influenced worldbeat, for sure.
__label__1 Worthless: Buyer beware... this item is PLASTIC!! It's nothing more than a glorified child's toy. It is nowhere near the value of what they have it priced at. The shadowbox does not have a clear cover and is completely open. The dagger is one piece of poorly painted molded plastic and what's worse...it's not even straight!!! The dagger has a downward curve that wouldn't be seen by the naked eye as it hangs, but is noticeable if you remove it and hold it at eye level. NECA should be embarrassed.
__label__1 Big Disappointment: With Kasparov's name on the title page I was looking forward to analysis on par with his other Pergamon/Cadogan books on matches 2 (New World Chess Champion) and 3 (London/Leningrad Championship Games). I was sadly disappointed. The analysis in here is very weak, on the level of what Keene usually provides in his hack jobs. I recommend the book by Karpov's team (ISBN 0812919238) instead.
__label__1 Need the updated version: I bought this to take with me on a trip to Asia. The flight takes much longer than my iPod's battery would last and this seemed to be a great solution. However, when I put fresh batteries in and connected my iPod, nothing happened. I then bought new batteries just in case, only with the same result. I contacted APC and they sent me a replacement. Long story made short: it produced the same result. Thus, I contacted APC again and this time they sent me the newer model, which does not have that tiny wire extension. Instead, you plug the iPod's USB cable directly into the main unit; the unit also has an LED light which lets you know that it actually works. My advice: skip this version and go for the newer model.
__label__1 Not the best, but gets the job done.: My husband and I bought this for our baby girls room since it matched her decor and we needed a hamper. When we got it we noticed that we had to re-sew on the velcro that holds the washable cloth on the frame. The cloth is too small for the frame and it easily folds back together.
__label__1 Useless card for Dell Axim PDA: I bought a new card and it failed in just a couple of days. From literature review it appears that this card has known issues with Axim PDA's and other devices. I contacted San Disk customer service and I am yet to hear from them. Stay away from this junk.
__label__1 Doo Rag: This product may be good for a very young child but not for a grown man. The doo rag was way to small. The only good thing about it was the color. Very poor quality product.It does not deserve any stars at all.
__label__2 A Great Guide for the Mushroom Lover: I have read quite a few mushroom books in my course of book reviewing, but I would have to say this is one of the best. This book has great coverage on propagation, cultivation, identification and collecting. I like the decision to leave out mushrooms of unknown edibility because it makes the book much more manageable.The photography is excellent. I liked the addition of habitat shots of where certain mushrooms grow. This would surely help anyone who is a collector.This book stayed on track and didn't try to be all things to all people. For instance, in the cultivation section, they tell you what to read for more information depending on the type of mushroom.This book has great information on all levels and is helpful guide for the novice to expert gardener.
__label__2 Wow! Loved it.: When my friend recommended this book to me, I was suspicious, because he couldn't explain what he loved so much about it, but I can!! It's inspiring! It made me think about my life and what I want to get from it. Actually, it made me think of lots of things, too many to mention here. And it just gets better as you read. Great story. I can't wait to read the sequel and find out what happens next!
__label__1 Almost all questions are from "PMP Exam Prep (4th Edition)": Deeply disappointed. Most of the questions are from Rita's another book "PMP Exam Prep (4th Edition)". Buying "PMP Exam Prep (4th Edition)" is enough. Don't waste your money on this one.
__label__1 Great bag for the price, but lasted only 9 months.: I got this for $9.95 so I have no complaints.It's holds tons of stuff, have lots of organizing pockets and compartments, and doesn't look cheap at all.Unfortunately, the seam between the fabric and the synthetic leather part of the top handle came apart, and I ended up tossing it in the garbage after less than 9 months.
__label__2 Decent guide for visitors to major Texas forts: This magazine-like book describes about three dozen forts "that held a key role in the Indian campaigns." Thus, only major forts are included (The Alamo, Forts Brown, Bliss, McIntosh, Duncan, Belknap, Stockton, Davis, to name just a few). When and where each fort was established, a brief historical account, and the state of the fort today are given in varying degrees of thoroughness. The last chapter is barely a listing of various less important forts. Many of these forts are today state or county parks and offer something of interest for the visitor to see. A handy guide for travelers visiting these sites.
__label__1 Seattle, WA: Illustrations for the iPad Kindle edition are in black and white, even though the format supports color, which is sort of a huge issue for a book about graphics and visual imagery.
__label__2 The Song EVERYONE WANTS IS NOT HERE: Its a song BY AZ from a GROUP called MOBSTYLE Holla AT JEKYLINDUSTRIEZ@YAHOO.COM
__label__1 What are you all talking about?: I'll give this 2 stars just for the beats.As far as being "cutting edge" and "radically new" and whatever other great sounding description these reviewers want to leave, this album is not.Elementary school kids could make an album more intelligible than this. If you want to listen to this CD, you're DEFINITELY gonna need to be on something. I can't imagine how one could stand it otherwise.
__label__2 Mimzyfied: I have seen two great childrens movies this year and this is one of them. The other is "Bridge to Terabithia". Two children find a box that holds unusual items. As they discover the items uses they begin to unfold a map to another time and place. As the items gain notice from adults they begin to scare adults. Afterall anything alien must be bad. Finally it comes down to whether the parents believe in their children or not. Thankfully they do and so when it becomes obvious who sent the items, the children are able to help them. I highly recommend this wonderful movie for the whole family.
__label__1 What?!?!?: Couldn't stand it. Stopped watching after the teacher got involved with the science fair- about an hour in, I think. I thought that maybe the movie was a slow builder- lots of exposition that would eventually pay off. All I got was some half-hearted acting, a pair of not-that-cute kids who carry around alien technology. You'd think there would be more drama. It also had some kind of preachy- the blood of the earth is on your hands if you don't tune into nature more often message. Can't say if it paid off or clarified, but I was done wasting my time.
__label__2 Philip Leitch: This is a truly great book. It gave me all the answers I was looking for, and I was looking for a lot of answers. The section on strings (windows strings) CComBSTR is indispensable (chapter 2). I can't understand how people could rate this book badly - I tried the rest and this was the best.The only down side, as I see it, is that the book is rather dry. Then again, if you expected anything other than a dry book you shouldn't be looking in non-fiction computer books. Humour was used but it was sarcastic and rather dry - quite frankly it should have been left out completely.The book was VERY full on, presenting vast quantities of information very quickly, with enough information to make things clear.
__label__2 Trainer is an excellent supplement to any personal weight loss program.: Jeanette Jenkins: The Hollywood Trainer is a DVD offering a twenty-one day total body circuit workout in just 30 minutes a day. Hosted by Jeanette Jenkins, founder and president of The Hollywood Trainer and professional trainer to Hollywood stars including Queen Latifah, Christina Applegate, and Carmen Electra.

__label__1 the price was fair: A interesting purchase for the sake of old time comedy television and some star power , but not nearly as much Johnny Carson as the cover would imply. This is very early Carson, in black and white.
__label__1 Disappointing: I found this to be a bit dull and boring. The write up of the book made it sound a lot better than it truly is.
__label__1 Shipped on time but parts are MISSING!: Although the item came within 10 days, it did not come with the AC adaptor. I have tried calling the customer service number located in the user guide for 2 weeks now and no one picks up the phone. I only get connected to a voice messaging system which NO ONE has returned yet. This is a christmas gift and it is very unfortunate that the gift won't be ready in time. I'm highly disappointed. This is an expensive item, and for it to not be functional is unacceptable.
__label__2 Wonderful classics!: It's wonderful to see Chip and Dale again. I just would have liked it if there were more than just three shorts! Luckily, the ones that they included is one where they are at odds with Pluto, and another where they are at odds with Donald Duck. Classic!
__label__1 Feedback: The VHS I purchased doesn't work. When I put it in it's black and white and is scrambled. Products should be tested before they are sold.
__label__1 No Moore, please... thanks.: I quite often found the book loosing ground at times with a creative story line pulled together with odd characters. It has silly humor no doubt but, at times seemed like the author was stealing from Theo's little garden. Definitely light reading for those who need a giggle or two.
__label__2 funny but not as good as his other stuff: Let me issue the disclaimer here first: Christopher Moore is a fantastic, zany and very funny author. But let's face it - It can't all be great. "Lust Lizard" was a little too choppy, even more so than "Practical Demon Keeping" and sometimes the prose fell flat where it tried to be funny. The characters were all well-rendered (as usual) but somewhere along the line, my interest in some of them started to wane. However, the story was still good for a chuckle and general amusement on a lazy weekend. Remember: No time is wasted on a Christopher Moore novel!
__label__2 Funny and hard to put down...: I read this while camping and having nothing else to do, which was fortunate because it was so hard to put down! I love the way Christopher Moore writes. This book is outside the box as usual just disturbing enough to be compelling without repellance. Funny!!!
__label__1 Barely readable: Not only is this thing an impossible premise, the style leaves one wandering about in limbo between episodic adventures. The characters, except for the Constable, are overwrought and unbelievable. Attempts at ironic humor are sophomoric. I say this, in spite of having thoroughly enjoyed both earlier books by Christopher Moore.Fool: A NovelLamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal
__label__1 Cindy: This item is a cheap cassette player. I will be buying a better one in time. Bulky.. but it does play ok. The headsets are also on the cheap side... I got what I paid for.
__label__1 Worth 12.00: The tape player, drug my cassetes;the radio was ok - but I needed a cassete player-radio, for my walks to the grocery store - and I didn't get it in this order,so I gave it away brand new.I intend to purchase online,another better quality walkman - hopefully, next month.JWIN JX-B32A AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player with Bass Boost (JWIN JXB32A)

__label__2 Excellent headphones!: These are a great pair of headphones for a great price. Its a steal. Definately would do business with seller again.
__label__2 I'm Surprised!: I'm surprised at how comfortable, lightweight and well put together these headphones are. They put out a decent frequency response and aren't harsh at all. They're well constructed and very affordable. I'd recommend them for the person who wants fair quality for a great price and not for the audiophile brats who are much too critical for their own ears.
__label__1 Zero for two: Bought one; didn't work (reached the end of the timing period but wouldn't ring); returned it; got another; same problem.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: I've had this timer for a while now and always had to nurse it along to get it to work by rapping it on its side after I set it. Also, always make sure to turn past 30 when setting it (winds up the internal spring).Well, I got tired of this procedure which worked if I was lucky about 50% of the time. It finally got tired itself and stopped working almost all the time now. It really is a piece of junk as many reviewers have stated here and has been relegated to the garbage bin. I don't know why I stayed with it so long. Save yourself the trouble and spring for a digital unit even if it's not as nostalgic.
__label__1 Piece of Junk...: Read the description carefully--it's a MECHANICAL timer. The alarm is armed with the spring-loaded dial. So the length is determined by the amount of winding you put to the dial--not very accurate and the alarm bell lasts only as much as you wind the dial--its sound is very harsh and gradually dies down as the spring winds down.I suppose this alarm could be good for the elderly because of its large numbers on the face and the dial...
__label__2 Buy this for your kids and watch it yourself!: My wife and I took a chance after a friend saw this at a screenign and told us about it. We love it as much as our kids. Very funny and things for kids and parents (especially dads)! High reccommendation!
__label__2 Nice rack!: Sorry, couldn't help myself. Great for hallway shoe rack! Getting another for the closet.
__label__2 Guitarist Baily Writes Brilliant and Very Informative Book: This book is absolutely essential for anyone seeking to learn more about modern music and approaching music in an historical manner. Baily explains the role of improvisation in a variety of music forms and in the process helps the reader attain greater knowledge and appreciation of these various genres. The only section that is lacking is the one regarding rock 'n' roll, which focuses on Steve Howe of the band Yes, a rather insignificant artist in modern songwriting and rock music. Other than that, this book is a masterpiece.
__label__1 the wedding dress: I wish this would have a little more back bone. Maybe I just like longer movies. If it were a little more meaty with a little longer plot it would have been a great movie. Instead it leaves you hanging and saying what?
__label__2 What a Godsend!: I have had an estrangement from my son for the last few years. I have shed many tears missing him. His wife refused to allow him to see any of the members of his family. No matter how many times I tried to re-connect, I was rebuffed. I was hurt and angry, even to the extent of calling him a wimp. Once I read this book, I realized that I was doing everything the wrong way. I tried several of the author's suggestions. Happily, I am now in touch with my son. We speak on the telephone and we e-mail. Hopefully, we will be together soon. This book was a Godsend.
__label__1 content vs. sound quality: the recording has a representative collection of Heifitz's concert standards, as well as some more obscure works. even after digital remastering, the poor sound quality detracts from the enjoyment of the pieces. apparently the original performances were for broadcast in the 1940's and early 50's. it sounds like someone had a recorder in front of the radio.should be of interest to collectors and music students, not audiophiles. the more popular pieces are available on other recordings; the others seem pretty rare.
__label__2 A must read.: I don't know what the previous reviewer was talking about, obviously someone with a chip on his shoulder. This is an amazing story. When I began this book I almost read it in one sitting, I tried to prolong it for another week but when I was done I wished there was a sequel. The telling of her story draws you in and makes you realize the lifestyle of a farmer is not something most people can do and the greatness of her achievements.this is a book that can every one should read
__label__1 Remarkably Bad - Yet Mildly Entertaining: Hell Swarm is one of those films you pick up thinking you may have stumbled onto a little sleeper of a film that no one but you knows about. After watching it you'll want to keep that secret to yourself - for all the wrong reasons.In truth there are elements of Hell Swarm that, in the right hands - and with a bit more of a budget - could be developed into a decent, gripping little thriller. Unfortunately those hands unfortunately are not Tim Matheson's, who directs (and acts in) the film.Boyd Kestner is appealing as the "hero" if a bit bumbling but the rest of the cast seem to have spilled over from WB shows that never aired.Even though there is some swearing, "decent" violence and sensuality, the entire affair feels like it was made for, well the WB Network or USA Up All Night.
__label__1 False Adverisement: This product used to be advertised as a spare UV bulb for pond clarifier, but it is really NOT an UV bulb. It costed me money and time. It is not economical for me to ship it back, and wish the supplier simply refund me the money without the product being returned but I doubt it since the supplier wants to make more money by false adverting the function of the product.
__label__2 ood stable camera: I like the fact that the camera uses compact flash. The compact flash cards come in sizes up to 4G so that is nice.Easy to use.
__label__1 Disappointment: What a waste of time. As an avid fan of Survivor I felt that the money spent was not worth it.This was boring, boring, boring and there was no excitement whats so ever and good have gone to a fine resturant for the money spent on this garbage. :(
__label__1 Was Hoping For Better: The title of the video led me to think that it would be clips of scenes that didn't make or couldn't be shown on national TV but, with few exceptions, it was basically nothing more than highlights of the TV program itself. To avoid nausea, fast-forward through the scenes with Susan in it.
__label__1 Boring: I'm sorry but I did not like this book one bit. Although I loved Mr. Commitment, also written by Mike Gayle, this book was nothing like Mr. Commitment. The book is a very slow read.
__label__1 horrible, horrible, horrible: One day I decided I needed to read every type of book out there. I usually ready fantasy novels. I wanted to know if I'd be interested in other books besides fantasy. I picked up a horror novel and it was slightly entertaining. Started to read a historical fiction novel but never finished. Then I picked up this up. I read the whole thing and decided never again to read a romance novel. This guy I forget his name now but he was so pathetic and weird. He wants to marry some girl from the telephone...stupid! But what pissed me off was the ending! DUMB!
__label__1 Westlife: Live at Wembley: Not realizing I ordered the PAL Format I could not play this DVD on my player. Had to send back and order one in the DVD format. Loved the DVD once it would play. Was on time as always and in great condition. Love Amazon!
__label__2 They're my Irish Toy Boys...: I was a total bum on New Year's Eve & sat in front of the Goggle Box_and watched Westlife Live At Wembley. It was fantastic! Definitely worth purchasing. You will enjoy totally it.
__label__1 Extremely Religious and if when not - very negative: Most of the songs on these CDs are very religious, so if you don't want your child to be exposed to that I would recommend looking for a different CD. On top of that when there are songs that are not religious they are just absolutely horrible. As an example of some of the lyrics:1) "I am squishing up the baby bumblebee (...) I am wiping off the baby bubmlebee (...) ouch it stung me (first of all bumblebees are the most adorable and they don't sting and what are the lyrics????)2) "you should have seen the monkhe sat on the elephant trunkthe elephant sneezed and fell on his kneesand that was the end of the monk"Seriously for little kids such lyrics? What do you expect your kids to grow up if that's what they listen to?
__label__1 Christian music: Whoops. I somehow missed that this is a collection that includes a bunch of religious songs, along with a bunch of old classics.
__label__2 Later work by a jazz guitar legend: The "gypsy jazz" guitar style pioneered by the much-revered Django Reinhardt underpins many of the best musette recordings. This is some of his later work, made in 1947 and 1953, when Reinhardt was in a state of semi-retirement. He had also become fascinated with bebop, which was the universal jazz form at the time. Paradoxically, his interest in the pyrotechnics of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker led Reinhardt to play in a style which was less dynamic and more lyrical than his classic work from the '30s, and he became a more subtly expressive player. Like Louis Armstrong in his later years, Reinhardt was undeniably a master musician, playing with a richness and soulful depth that few musicians could hope to match. Sadly, he died of a brain hemmorage not long after the last of these recordings, in 1953. This 2-CD set is pretty swell... definitely worth checking out!
__label__1 Flaky Memory Card: I bought this memory card to use with my MP3 player and have found it to be very unreliable. It has lost tracks that I have put on it and acted in other flaky ways like unexpectedly skipping over tracks. I'm looking into getting a replacement - Verbatim offers a lifetime warranty...
__label__2 One year and loving it: I brought this last year from Amazon during the thanksgiving blowout. I was a little hesitant and was leaning more towards Sony or Samsung. But after reading the reviews and comparing the models at BestBuy went ahead and bought it. I had absolutely no problem with it in the one year I had it except for one pixel in the screen that went bad. Recommended.
__label__2 Beatiful!!!: I love my new TV. The colors are vivid, the image quality is pretty good even when it's not in HD channels. Besides, I think is stylish, looks great in my living room./
__label__2 AL4rfun: We have two other Sharp LCD TVs so I researched various LCD TVs online for a birthday gift for my husbandand and I kept coming back to the Toshiba 32HL67U. I couldn't find a better deal for the features and price. We've had the TV for three weeks now and I love it. My husband on the other hand is still not sure if he likes it because he really wanted the Sharp 32 inch but I think he is seeing that this TV has everything that he would have gotten in a Sharp without the higher cost. The only negative I have is that there is a delayed response when turning the TV on (maybe about a 5 second delay).Update 2011This TV stop working after 18 months so I would not recommend a Toshiba to anyone ever. To repair cost more that we were will to pay because there was no guarantee that this wouldn't happen again. Stick with Sharp or Sony...
__label__1 Beware - panel dies after almost 2 years - Rip OFF: Like others, I have owned my 32HL67U for almost 2 years. Loved it. Picture great and enjoyed it. NOW - a piece of junk. I compared my problem to others and have concluded, I need to replace it. Screen nor menus appear when I turn on. I turned it off and unplugged the inputs to no avail. DEAD TV. Pissed off. Last Toshiba for me.
__label__1 Broke after 6 months: I bought this television because of the good reviews. After about 6 months the screen started going blank. I would turn it off and back on and the picture would come back. Finally it went completely blank and never would re appear. I took it to a service center and am waiting to get it back. I never thought the picture quality was that good except on HD programs.
__label__1 Broke after 3 months: We had our TV three months before it broke -- it started turning on and off on its own until it just wouldn't turn on again. We gave the TV to the service center (authorized by Toshiba) who told us the part they needed was back-ordered at Toshiba. Over two weeks later, we're still in the queue to have Toshiba simply look for the part, with no guarantees as to if or when they'll find it. We've had to make multiple phone calls just to get Toshiba to do anything at all -- and we've had to act as the middle man between the authorized service center and Toshiba. I definitely won't be buying another Toshiba TV after this experience!
__label__2 beautiful: This TV is great. picture quality is awesome. I also have a 42" 1080p projection of another brand. Picture quality in both is so close you wouldn't know the difference. But the richness in the color of the lcd is unmatched.
__label__2 Toshiba 32" LCD: TV looks great, priced right. However, delivery was a hassel, took to long almost 2 weeks, but once I made contact with shipper (which you must do doesn't say that any where) things went smoother.
__label__2 Great canera!maybe more than enough for some...: Using the camera in the Auto mode takes nice pictures(basically point and shoot) very nice for the begginers. The maual mode is where you will get it's best. However, Use of the manual mode will take little more understanding in basic operation of camera. What is minimum or basic?Personally--->EX: you should atleast know what the shuttle speed and amperature is. if not, you still can study...but if not planning on professional use, consider somthing cheaper. I bought this and love it. I am not a pro photographer but have basic experience plus I love challenge/learning. so far the only complaint is the Multi controller which is hard to select. the battery was ok for me. I dont think ill get an extra. go to local electronics store and try it out.Conclusion:have the money, like new challenge, great pictures... buy it. I dont have bit of regret, but thats me.
__label__2 Great photos and User Friendly: I searched, compared, and waited for the technology to be put in a small compact package. This camera has a lot of excellent automatic and manual features for taking great night and day photos with excellent color. It also has a 30 second movie option with sound that is a lot of fun. I like the fact that I can plug right into the television to view photos and movie clips. The software is also nice. I would recommend buying an extra battery and much larger compact flash card.
__label__1 Disappointing: This plunger must only work on certain types of toilets, because I couldn't get an airtight seal - at least, not with the larger attachment. However, I discovered that the smaller attachment - meant for sinks and whatnot - did help a bit to at least DRAIN the toilet, but not clear the clog.I can recommend this for sinks and other drains, but not for toilets. At least, not my toilet.
__label__2 Excellent Movie: Love the old movies, we have walked out of almost every movie we have attended in the last 10 years
__label__1 FAKE JERSEY: If you are looking for the real Reebok replica jersey distributed by the NFL this is NOT it! This is a fake jersey with cheap embroidery whereas the originals are screen printed. It is the wrong color blue and is made of cheap material. Don't waste your money!
__label__1 Not That Great: I just could not get into this book, it was all over the place. Book did not really get good to me until the last few chapters.
__label__1 Disappointing Ending: The ending was so disappointing. It seemed so rushed, was not as suspenseful as the whole novel. I liked it for the most part because it is very vivid, creative, different but the ending just ruined it.
__label__1 Too Much Talk not enough action: In the words of Paul Revere and the Raiders, this book has "Too much talk and not enough action." Would have made a good edited short story. To many conversations where the characters repeat themselves. Got bored with this.
__label__2 Rally spell binding book: I have read almost all her books and each one is a spellbinding. It is really hard to put down.
__label__1 Very Dissapointed: There wasn't much to this book at all. I was very dissapointed in it. Did not find helpfull at all.
__label__1 Horrible acting and plot.: Undeveloped and corny characters acted by horrible actors. I wish the Philippine movie industry would shape-up and produce high quality movies!
__label__1 Lost weight but horrible side effects: I started taking this last Friday as directed on the package...two caplets three times a day. The first day I felt really sick to my stomach and really bloated and gassy. I also had diarrhea. It was also difficult to sleep. The second day the gassiness was still there but not as bad but I started to get really bad dizzy spells. The third day it was the same thing, but I woke up with three HUGE pimples on my face. Not normal little pimples these are enormous and very painful. I decided to continue as I was losing weight, but I took only one caplet three times a day - so cut my dosage in half. The fourth day I found another huge pimple on my neck and decided to stop taking the drug. I lost 4 pounds in the three days I took it but seriously I would rather just diet and exercise more than deal with the acne and bloated feeling. I did feel more calm and relaxed but again, the side effects aren't worth it to me.
__label__1 Hair Loss: Yeah, for all of you people - keep taking the product you may experience the same results as I am now. After taking Relacore fore few weeks my hair started to fall out. It happened like over night the first day I lost two hand fulls of hair. I used to have long, thick hair. Now my hair is thin and you can see my scalp. Not only that it keeps falling out more. So, I am 30 years old and I am going bald. Read the label. It says hair loss. Be careful and stop talking it before its too late. I called customer service, they telling me to send back the pills and they will give me my money back. I don't care about that. I wanted to contact someone who knows if my hair will ever grow back. I was told that the hair loss side effect is written there just in case. That people never that these side effects. I went online, read customer reviews and I am not the only one who is losing hair. Some other side effects: fatigue, stomach cramps, drowsiness, not able to concentrate, acme, dry scalp.
__label__2 Best Metal Album of 2004!: This is not only the best Metal CD of 2004 but could be the best comeback album ever! This could be Exodus's best CD! Get this! It shreds! I love it! Every Metal collection needs this CD! Will go down as a classic!
__label__1 Misleading: This is not a live album, but studio tracks dubbed with a fake live audience. No wonder this product has been discontinued. The engineers did a poor job of dubbing the so called live audience.
__label__1 Poor Quality Product: Having taught French and Spanish prior to my retirement, I know what to look for in teaching a foreign language. This course is probably the poorest quality I have yet to see.Lesson 1 begins by giving you a few basic words in Turkish in rapid succession then goe to chapter six...which is quite advanced...All in lesson 1. No time is given to practice the pronunciation before moving on to the next word or phrase. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 Could not put it down.: This book as been in print for some time but that does not, in any way at all, diminish it's impact for a new reader. This is a searing, powerful book full of amazing prose, intense characters and a darkly beautiful storyline. Alexander has a fantastic quality to his writing and the fact that this book apparently, 'won' the Whitbread but was stripped due to it's content makes it all the more compelling! Enjoy.
__label__1 Reminded me of Creative Writing Class: ...back in the day. How this book received much acclaim is beyond me. Perhaps because of the hoopla surrounding the Whitbread prize? It's not so much that the subject matter is distasteful (which it is, but so was Lolita, and that was a damn good book), but the story line plods along (I did lots of skim reading, and don't think I missed much) and Jessie's motivations, in the end, are ridiculous. The only thing that kept me going was my desire to know how her brain worked, however warped...that never happened. A friend moving overseas gave me all her books, this one included. Thank God I didn't spend money on it...not worth a cent.
__label__2 great book by a great teacher: I'm writing to recommend a unique book from one of my teachers that has just been published. It is called "Learning to Read Midrash," and helps provide you with a basic methodology for accessing midrashic literature. The author, Simi Peters, is a gifted teacher and writer who draws on traditional and academic sources to really bring the material alive. Her class at my yeshiva last year, Nishmat, first thing on Sunday mornings (!!??) has been one of the highlights of my learning here in Israel.
__label__2 Had to watch: Watching The Avengers (which I purchased) gave me an appetite for more of the Black Widow. This was good, but I rented it.
__label__2 Iron Man 2: We bought it from amazon.com it is a great movie on blu ray. Arrived exactly when it was suppose to, on the first day on the market. I was so excited. Almost as good as Iron Man the original movie.
__label__2 Better than the first!!: Great Movie!! Interesting story line - great effects!!! I think it might be better than the first!
__label__1 Sequels rarely turn out well: I think actors get too excited/confident if the original movie does well and decide they want to put on a really good show the next time. Or maybe it's the director because everything in this movie fails; the acting and special effects, were well over done. So disappointing: Downey, Rourke and Cheadle are three of my favorite actors. Hopefully this isn't the end.
__label__2 Great followup to excellent first movie: Couldn't pass up buying this movie when it was dirt cheap at $10!Iron man is one of my sons favorite action stars and he watches the first two movies over and over.I like the overall story, think it was a great follow up to first movie, and cant wait for the next one due out 2013.
__label__1 Big letdown.: I can't add anything that hasn't been already stated. The scene where the Ironman suit gets stolen by somebody who has never stepped inside of one before made me cringe.The scenario is so typical now...sequels to blockbuster's are just half-assed thrown together because they know theye are gonna make money regardless. At least it was only wasted NF rental for me.
__label__1 Item didn't play: Not only did the disk not work, it is now stuck inside my player. I have to take my player to a repair shop and PAY to have the disk removed.
__label__1 great for 6 year old boys, adults kind of boring! very little charachter development and very obvious speical effects a no go: great for 6 year old boys, adults kind of boring! very little charachter development and very obvious speical effects a no go
__label__2 Awesome Movie Love the Iron Man movies: Liked it great BR, and includes the DVD and digital copy for iTunes. What else can you ask for, great value, and awesome movie. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
__label__2 An amazing time: Although I was in my teens at the end of the 70s I still managed to get an idea of how fast - or slow - gay liberation was happening before the scourge arrived. "Gay Sex in the 70s" reminds me strongly of that time. It's difficult to comprehend now how dichotomous were the times: widespread homophobia and oppression, coupled with a flowering queer expression.....er, yeah, just like now. Except it was a whole lot more innocent. This album is a compilation of those first expressions of joy and liberation and, if you can get past the dated sound, is a great listen.
__label__2 As Men Grow: This is a book about how men grow. Men don't often look at themselves and their growth. They just age. This book adds meaning and touch points to this process.
__label__1 horrible sound: i'm a great fan of Julio Iglesias, but this DVD should never have been released with an absolutely apalling sound quality as well as a poor selection of songs. I'm totally amazed any producer would put such poor sound quality on a DVD.
__label__1 Gold chain: I wore this for 5 days, and it turned BLACK I threw it away...I dont believe it was advertised correctly, but then again you get what you pay for, I will be getting my jewelry in person from now on.
__label__1 Interesting... but disappointing: As a fan of the Smiths, I couldn't resist buying this tribute. Some of the songs are interesting, but I have to say that most are not worth listening. My wife who is even a bigger Smiths fan couldn't even sit through most of the songs! Well, we are just disappointed with this album.
__label__2 The BEST!!!!: I dont know what the others are talking about!!! I recieved this as a gift about 10 years ago, the only reason I dont still have it is because someone stole it about 3 years ago. I have been looking for this exact one ever since!!! So glad I finally found it again!!! This is the BEST cd shower radio ever!!! Got it really wet often with out any problems, gets great reception, quality of sound is great,batteries last a very long time and I used it everyday! Great for taking to the beach also! Total win! Can't wait for it to arrive so I can start using it again! I have bought others over the last few years and they all were terrible... THIS IS THE ONE!!! Thanks :)
__label__1 Eh..it's does the job..but: We got this to keep our older son in track to finish his homework. Unfortuantely, the quality is not that great and it's not that loud when the alarm rings. My daughter accidently dropped it from the table to the floor and the front plastic cover came off. Also the back metal stand stopped staying in place after awhile. There are others that are much better..you get what you pay for. This was cheap and so it was. Live and learn.
__label__1 can't hear timer: The timer pitch is way to high I can only hear it when it is against my ear. My dog can hear it just fine.
__label__1 Junk, lasted two cycles before LCD row burned out: I thought it was just the battery, but the entire 2nd horizontal row burned out, making it unreadable within MINUTES of using! Literally 5 minutes use and its junk. Needs a reset button (To reset time, need to pause, then hit M and S together. Rather flimsy device. If I didnt throw away the packaging, I would have returned it to the store - although driving it back would cost as much in gas & burn up an hour of my day. MADE IN CHINA. I should have learned by NOW!
__label__1 works, but no on/off switch/button: The timer works and has a memory feature, but there is no way to turn it off when you are finished! You have take out the battery to keep from draining the battery down! Quite useless to keep up with the battery when not in use!
__label__1 Cheaply made. Dead on Arrival.: The timer was very light and apparently cheaply made. It was dead on arrival out of the box.
__label__2 Perfect!: Exactly what I wanted. I previously had this very same timer for more than 20 years and when it broke I was delighted to find I could purchase the exact same model.
__label__1 The *worst* timer on the market!!! (absolute junk!): I actually bought this timer from Target a couple days ago and it was the worst piece of junk I have bought in a long time. It took me about 15 minutes to get it up and running (you have to use a screwdriver to remove the back panel). And then the battery housing doesn't align with the spring that keeps the battery in place. Normally, the spring is inside the battery housing, but not with this version. It's too difficult to explain how the pieces fit together, but it took me 6 or 7 minutes just to get the battery in place. And then once I reassembled the thing and twisted the screws back into place, the back panel of the device wasn't applying enough pressure to the battery and it would slip out of place and go dead. I'm just glad I held onto my receipt, coz I intend to return this junk and try to convince the store manager to stop carrying the Taylor brand.
__label__1 Too cheap: Bought one at Targe and upon opening it and trying it out realized I'd wasted my money. Loose attacment of magnet means you can't use it while on the fridge .Beep is very weak, too soft to be heard if anything else is going on. In a word, useless. When will someone make one with a BIG magnet that will never fall off in use??
__label__1 Clock problems...: Right from the beginning we had a problem. The first night we set the clock to the correct time and then programmed the machine to start brewing at 5:30am the next morning. When I checked the machine at 5:30 am the brewing had not started because the clock now read 1:30am......ok, so maybe it got bumped. One design problem is it's REALLY easy to bump the clock buttons.....BUT it would have had to have been bumped 20 times! So I reset the clock and pushed the on button to start brewing right away.....no big deal. That afternoon at about 3:30pm I decided to go program the machine to brew a pot about 4pm or so, but once again I find the clock is EXACTLY 4 hours behind.....AGAIN.Long story short, don't trust the clock which also means it is useless to program the machine and expect a steaming pot of coffee when you wake up.
__label__1 Security hazard: One replaced after two months not heating anymore. Another one which died one year later, not heating anymore too. It was a good opportunity to notice that the bottom/base was damaged (by normal use!!!) and that potentially coffee could be in contact with the wires in the base. A colleague of mine told me she had the same issue at home (damaged base). This could set a fire.The clock is perfect. The coffee was OK.Crappy model. Black and Decker should test properly its products.
__label__1 noble flop: this cd was not what I expected considering the musicians on the cd...one big bomb, but the purpose behind the cd was noble
__label__1 Not Worth Ordering: Very light weight and the non-stick surface does not work well. Spend more and go for a better skillet.
__label__1 Farberware Classic 12-Inch Nonstick Deep Skillet: Farberware Classic 12-Inch Nonstick Deep SkilletThis product was not what it appeared to be. It is very cheaply made. I also ordered the lid which didn't fit onto the pan. I had this shipped to my daughter in CT and they threw away all the packing receipts or I would have returned it.Horrible.
__label__1 Despicabale: Not only did he exploit a child but he exploited an entire culture as well as his students. I wish all the students at NJCU would boycott his class. He is a self-centered, egotistical, unethical, selfish human being. He should be ashamed of his actions. I don't want to write more, even though I could go on because I know he reads this personally and it will only feed into his huge ego even more. Pathetic!
__label__2 Underratted by 1/2 a star: I first read this book ten years ago and it is still my favorite. The concept of Death playing a trivia machine, and War being a foreign correspondent is too humorous for words. The contest for the affections of the antichrist by the regional managers of heaven and hell is also a delightful absurdity.
__label__2 Divine and beautiful: Well, it's as funny as everyone says :-). I read it. And re-read it. And seven years later, I'm still finding new jokes, and only yesterday did I finally understand the ending :-). I'm ashamed to admit it made me cry with happiness (or possibly hysteria). The astonishing amount of in-jokes and cultural references from Queen to Yeats make it absorbing reading and the morals and ideas crammed haphazardly in make it something of a classic. The prose is skillful and pretty, but what I enjoyed most about this book was its warmth and humanity. The characters are simply delicious, and I defy anyone not to fall in love with Crowley and Aziraphale, who are adorable seperately and perfect together ;-). In the end, I found the book simply uplifting - I'm afraid I flatly disagree with those who found the ending "a disappointment". Bittersweet, hilarious, powerful and poignant - very, very human. It's ineffable, dear boy, don't you know? :-)
__label__2 Great Read: Since Neverwhere, I have been a huge Neil Gaiman fan. I really enjoy his writing style, and this one was excellent. A lady at the bookstore recommended this book to me, and I was definitely not disappointed. It's a very strange tale, but also funny and intellectually intriguing. Excellent novel.
__label__2 Good Omens is Just Plain Good Fun: It is in England, eleven years before the Apocalypse, when the demon Crowley's worst fear is realized. He receives a summons from Hell to pick up the Anti-Christ and deliver the infant to a human family. The only problem is, Crowley likes the world and doesn't want it destroyed. And so, he enlists the help of his long-time rival, the angel Aziraphale, and the two set off to save humankind. Pratchett and Gaiman deliver an exquisitely crafted novel, and a hilarious and poignant examination of the most complex character of all--human nature. Consider yourself warned--this book will have you laughing to yourself in the middle of the night and when you've turned the last page--leave you thinking.
__label__1 frustrating, wild romp to nowhere: I love Neil Gaiman. I love Terry Pratchett. I hate Good Omens. In a frustrated attempt to read the book cover to cover, I was twarted many times by books that were much funnier, more pleasant to read, and more comprehendable(anyone by Goodkind or all other Gaiman/Pratchett books, jordon, adams). This book did not make sense, was a half hearted attempt at low brow humor (which unfortunately did NOT work) and why read this if you can spend your time elsewhere? It's a good omen you read this review before thinking about buying the book..don't waste your time or money like I did.
__label__1 So Disappointed....: I purchased this book after seeing it mentioned more than a few times as "one of the funniest books" people had ever read. I consider myself to have a pretty decent sense of humor, and love British wit, so really looked forward to this one. Read to page 200, had not had more than one tiny snicker, and gave up. This book will go into work into our "free for the taking" bookshelf where we trade off paperbacks.
__label__1 Almost like pulling teeth, although not quite as enjoyable.: I actually purchased this book by reading the online reviews on Amazon, I should have heeded the warnings about boredom. This book is a mish mash, hodge podge, and any other cliche you care to throw in there. The authors struggle to emulate the Adam's humor but only succeed in wasting the readers time. Overly verbose and dry, I found myself skipping long chunks of dialogue just to get to the ending.
__label__1 LOVE Gaiman, but this was the worst book I've read in a long time!!!: I am a true Gaiman fan, but I do not feel that this book was a good one. It was too light for me. I was so annoyed by the lack of plot and the fact that the plot there was didn't make any sense that I did not even laugh once at the "funny" notations on every page. This book was one of the worst ones I have read in a long time and it pains me to say this about Gaiman, but it is the truth. If you are really drawn to purchase this book---do yourself a favor and read a chapter before purchase you'll be glad you did. This book was terrible. If this was really genius then it is totally over my head and I am totally unaware of it. I kept reading it instead of putting it down because it was Gaiman and I kept thinking it has to be worth it in the end. Much to my dismay it was not. It was horrible the entire way through.
__label__2 What was God REALLY thinking?: Yeah, it's hilarious, and yeah, comparisons to Hitchhiker'sGuide are inevitable, but, well, look. Forget 'Who Wrotethe Bible?' because this is it. The first chapter says itall. The humor is excellent, and the theme of the realitybehind the supposed war between heaven and hell is one thatGaiman has explored more than once; it's reminiscent of"Sandman: Season of Mists" and the short story "MurderMysteries" (from the collection "Angels and Visitations").This is an ideal partnership and one that I, for one,applaud.
__label__2 Fantastic Read: What a ripper ! Smart, sassy, funny, clever, in fact all of the things you would expect from a Neil Gaiman book.
__label__1 skip it: First, I've only read about 125 pages of this book so perhaps it has some dramatic improvements I'm missing...BUT overall it isn't very clever and it's rather uninteresting. There are pages of setup for jokes that fall flat. It's British so you may have trouble if you're American and don't know some British slang (Tubes are subways etc..) I have a pretty eclectic sense of humor and this book didn't appeal to any of the wide-ranging aspects of humor I appreciate- irony, sarcasm, wacky stuff, satire, wit, ..this had none worth mentioning.
__label__2 There's a God above & a Devil below, and they teamd up !!!: What can be said that haven't been already ? Only once or twice in a life time do we get these kind of writers... this time both of them created this master piece together. Between complex & hilarious lies the quirky, and all of them behave like one happy family of serial killers. Every character you meet is someone you already met/wished you'd meet/woke up in the middle of the night drenched in cold sweat just from dreaming about meeting them. From the nutty beginning to the - although endlessly hinted upon in the book (& then misunderstood...) - surprising ending(?), You hold on alternately to the edge of your chair/stomach... Let us join in prayer for a sequel (although any other team up of those two will make my day/year).READ IT !!! AGAIN & AGAin & Again & again....
__label__1 Corrupted Kripke!: In this book the work of Kripke is victim of a simple and irrelevant interpretation.The writing is coarse and lacks the indispensable level.If your are interested in philosophy of the language... looks for another book!
__label__1 $9.37 for the batteries.: Talk about a waste of money. $9.37 for the two button batteries at the local Rite Aid. Then you almost need to have a jeweler to change the silly things. The screws you need to remove the batteries are very small and unless you have excellent vision you will need a magnifying glass and a pair of tweezers to put the screws back. One of the screws holds the fragile battery contact in place. I will never ever buy another timer that uses these expensive batteries. $7.99 for the timer and $9.37 for the batteries...dumb.
__label__1 Not for the professional kitchen: We've chewed through several of these timers at our restaurant. They just don't hold up to heavy use. Here is a summary of issues we've had: screen blanks out; alarm fails to go off when times runs out; alarm chirps randomly and incessantly (this one was broken in half before being thrown away); the buttons get easily gummed up and stick. Plus, there is no easy way to change the battery. I'm assuming you have to remove the tiny screws in the back but we've never had one last long enough for the battery to run out.
__label__2 Taylor Timer: Great kitchen Timer! Very nice large easy to see numbers with loud easy to hear beeper. Nice magnetic backing that adheres well to my range hood where it is easy to see and use. This is my second one and I love it, it is so easy to use. One button, one finger operation. Amazon delivered quickly and at the best price.
__label__1 decent design, poor execution: I was looking for a timer with a keypad for entering digits, instead of up and down arrows, and I chose this one. Unfortunately, the buttons do not work consistently. Pressing a button can result in zero, one, or two digits. The outcome appears to be random. For example, you can press "3" and "0" hoping for 30 seconds and end up with 3 minutes (3-0-0) or 3 minutes and 30 seconds (3-3-0). Replacement batteries cost as much as the timer itself. I would not buy this timer again.
__label__1 Terrible Timer: I have used several timers and use them throughout the day almost every day. I bought four of these because they were inexpensive. I was disappointed to find that the last time set does not reset when the timer signal sounds, a feature that other timers have. Also the signal gets scratchy or static-y at times. One of the magnets fell off the back of one and the stands have two positions, one of which they don't remain in very well.Overall, I am disappointed and will not purchase these again. I think Pampered Chef makes the best timer, but was looking for something more reasonably priced, especially since my children use them as well.
__label__1 No Refunds with This Product: I tried writing a review on this product and it did not pass the approval process to be displayed by Amazon Customers, Why? I have reviewed many products without being rejected. I was not cursing or saying bad things about this vendor, Just the Truth. I would give this Vendor a rating of 0 if possible. Let's see if Amazon would let a low review be seen by Amazon Customers? Will not buy from this Vendor Ever!
__label__1 Installing on Mac OS with Parralel Desktop ?: Hi,Does it work for installing Microsoft Windows Vista Home Basic UPGRADE [DVD] on new Macbook Pro after installing a Parralel Desktop.3. ????please advisewith many thanks.
__label__1 This is a disappointing timer: This timer is a disappointment. A key feature of a count-down timer is the alarm. The alarm on the 5807 is inaudible beyond 10 feet. Say, you set the time for one hour and then do something else. At the end of the hour you cannot hear the alarm go off. So, you do not know that the time is up.Another poor feature is that the timer can be set for either hours and minutes or for minutes and seconds. It cannot be set for hours, minutes, and seconds.I intend to look for a better kitchen timer.
__label__2 Life in the 82nd Airborne in WWII.: One hears alot about the 101 Airborne Screaming Eagles, especially after Ambrose's books on the subject. I liked this book, and got a better look at what life was like in the 82nd. You get sad when the author talks about the bodies the author comes across (Huertegen Forest) when the author comes across this battlefield. So many died for our country, and those that endured this agony didn't have it much better.This is a nice memoir of the author's role in WWII. I got a better glimpse of what life was like in the 82nd. The author portrays how it was in both combat and rear areas. He talkes of his loss of friends and comrades in battle. He also talks about his early poverty and why he joined the army. An interesting story from a patriot.
__label__1 Descending to Boredom: I wish I could recommend this book because Mr. Wurst undoubtedly has an interesting story to tell, he just didn't tell it well. It lacks specifics and fails to draw you into his story, reading much like pages from a diary. Too dry, too general, too boring. If this book were a parachute it would fail to open.
__label__2 This thing is great!!!: I just bought this earlier today, I have burned 3 DVD-R's with no trouble. I have only been able to burn at 4x because that is the max on my media. I am very satisfied so far. It installed easy, and it came with a great software package. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a top of the line DVD Burner.
__label__1 Waste of Money: Waste of money not 320. It sounds muffled in a system, buyers beware.I do not recommend. Should have to advertise bit rate.
__label__1 Bloated, broken and bilious: Worst OS I have ever seen in 25 years...Does not function even on factory installs, unbelievably slow, and NON user friendly.Wireless and wired connections will not start, will not retain settings, and disconnects randomly.If doing an upgrade, buy a new hard drive! Remove your old one, and set it on a shelf. If you have any problems with the install, you can put the old hard drive in, and continue working. Crashed intalls can wipe out EVERYTHING, and it can take WEEKS to get everything running.Requires up to 25 gigs of hard drive space...
__label__1 Vista will not network with XP: I just bought a new Sony notebook for my son who is going to college in September. Vista Home Premium was pre installed on the Sony. Plugged it into my home network, whidh has 3 XP machines on it. The XP machines network fine. The Vista machine does not see the XP machine and the XP machines do not see the vista.After an hour and 45 minutes on the phone with Sony they announced that they do not deal with network issues.45 minutes on the pnone with Linksys and they told me the issue was not related to network equipment.Microsoft charged me $79 for support. I was on the phone with them for over 3 hours. I went through 3 levels of support the first two from India. The third level was from the US, but seemed genuinely puzzled.My advice is do not buy Vista if you have any plan of networking your visat machine with an xp machine.
__label__1 A huge step backwards: Microsoft has really missed the mark and has taken a huge step backwards with this latest operating system. I have had a retail version of Windows Vista sitting on my desk, uninstalled, for almost 6 months now. Meanwhile, my computer is stilling running Windows XP and it's going to stay that way for some time to come! Windows Vista is slower, buggier and less productive than Windows XP regardless the hardware you use on it.
__label__1 Billy Pay Me: Plenty Of Grandfathers could tell the same story, yet nobody is giving them a publishing deal. Another in the line of celebrity books. At least Jay Leno's new book was funny.
__label__2 perfect gift for a grandpa to be: This book is absolutely adorable. While it was written from the perspective of a dad to his pregnant (with girl) daughter, the sentiments are truly lovely.
__label__2 Wonderful Game!: I think that Capcom did an excellent job creating this game. The graphics are stellar and the storyline is great. It keeps your attention and you definitely have to use brainpower to figure out the BEST way to have Zack complete the task. This game was definitely slept on by A LOT of people but I hope that they create a sequel. This is one of those games that you can play over and over again.
__label__1 Life is what it looks like at first glance: nice movie about corrupt politicians, whether they be Democrat, Republican or Green Party. A good case for term limits.Nice to see a movie about old school schools and about how well meaning teachers who want to give promising but failing students an extra boost at other, more deserving student's expense.If anyone learns a lesson in this movie, it is the teacher who learns that bad boys grow up to be bad men, and smart, forgiving boys grow up to be smart, forgiving men.
__label__1 What?!!!: I can't believe all of the good reviews this film is receiving. It is manipulative, cliched and formulaic. Kline does not give a performance of his caliber. The direction is shoddy and the writing preposterous. I can't believe reviewers on here like the movie as much as they do. I thought it was just awful.
__label__1 Horrible Movie: If you view this movie within the world of Mr. Hundert (kevin klein) and and his view on life as a teacher, you should appreciate this movie more then i have. I instead gave it a perspective from judging the maturity and psychological development of all the characters throughout the storyline and as a result found it disgustingly random and inconseqential. The only real character in the movie was Mr. Hundert.The other figures in the story have a simplistic one-sided personality to augment the movies only apparant conflict of intergirty vs. corruption.Remember, if you ever do see it, concentrate on Kevin Klein, and no one else.
__label__1 craftsmanship issues: main clock is not synched with projection clock - those are actually set separatelybroke within a few weeks...
__label__1 very dissappointed: The clock is one hour behind every 3 hours, which can not be called inaccurate, this is like a joke. The projection's clock is accurate. But as you can not see it in daylight, it doesn't help much. If you are thinking about buying this product, think again, don't let the low price fool you. It is not worth it.
__label__2 Another Great Lonely Planet Edition!: I used this book for my trip to Western Europe last year. Overall you just cannot beat Lonely Planet travel guide books. I ended up staying at many hotels that were mentioned in the book. The maps are great. It is a pretty big book to haul around in your backpack but I would rather have a big book with valuable content than a smaller book without good information.
__label__2 Unknow World: In the ant world,there's an ant scout that came back with an unknown crystal from a far away place.The queen of the ant colony damands the ants get more crystals. A group of ants set off to find more crystals.The ants end up in an unusual world.This book was fun and exciting because of the danger the ants were in.By Dontre' and Derrick
__label__2 beautiful: i am one of those people that keeps their jewelry on always- rings, wrist cuff, necklace, earrings. .. . and watch. so i knew i wanted a 'blue' by fossil because they are waterproof to 100 meters. i actually bought this from the fossil site for $115, with the 10 year warranty. however, that one somehow got fogged up on the inside, so i had to have it replaced. the new one's mop was not quite so beautifully colored, but after wearing this watch almost every single day for over a year i still get random compliments. (i have lost 3 crystals now, though it isn't noticed to anyone unless i point it out.) today i met another woman with the same watch (except her face is white) and we both gushed at how much we loved it. .. .
__label__1 A book for beginners and non-artists: If you are looking for a book with lots of ideas and inspiration for working in polymer clay, this is not the one to buy. The first half of the book is devoted to techniques and would be helpful for the first time clay user, though there are very few photos to guide you.The projects in the second half are of the craft variety, a picture frame, jewelry box, etc. They would be great for beginners, but not very challenging or interesting for experienced artists.I returned this book within a half hour of receiving it.
__label__2 thanks: great service great communication......product as described . arrived on time all components . would do business with this company again
__label__2 Review: This is a great book and I recommend it. Lots of action and it takes you through a roller coaster of different like hilarious, jeolusy,humiliation,and especially revenge.
__label__1 Altered soundtrack: I anxiously bought this release only to find that someone though the films would be better if new music was added to the soundtrack. The case says it has the original audio but it doesn't say that music has been added. Thank goodness I was able to exchnage this disc for something else. Why can't they leave things alone?
__label__1 NOT REMASTERED: Hallmark owns the rights to the Laurel and Hardy sound films. They do not care about using the best available prints. The kirch Group in England only used the best available 35mm originals for their Laurel and Hardy dvds. We in America get a Dvd with added "modern sounding" music and a TV print, not the original masters. Hallmark does not care and will not respond to emails. I will not buy ANYTHING by Hallmark or Artisan until they get it right.Hallmark will not sell the rights to people who really would do something for the preservation and restoration of these films. These films have never been "remastered" in America. A very angry fan.
__label__2 Suzy comes through: The last edition of Born to Shop disappointed me becasue Suzy Gershman's interest seemed so narrow that the stores and places she liked were too far out of my range. In this edition she's made some changes. Cheap shopping is listed and the luxe, nowhere else except NYC stores are listed as well. She must have gotten some younger helpers because much to my delight the Sean Jean store and and Triple Five Soul shop are mentioned too. One thing I've always liked about the Born to Shop series is that the advice shows you how to get around town safely, how to buy quality and how to have a good time with as few hassles as possible. And don't think this book is just for women. In our last trip to NY my husband frequently consulted it and was very pleased with the directions and commentary.This book and Gerry Frank's guide are all you really need to take a weekend NYC trip.
__label__1 You won't learn how to be a stand up comic reading this book: While reading this book is mildly amusing, you will not learn how to construct a joke or bring out your funny side by reading it. In short you won't learn much about "how to be a stand up comedian". I was disappointed because I do think Belz is a funny guy. I just didn't think the book was very instructive.
__label__1 Had to return them: The loops don't fit on all reformers. I have a pilates power gym and the loops did not reach all the way. Ended up returning which was a hassle because Schott Pilates is in Canada so it cost me to ship back. Amazon will not deal with return, you have to go straight to the manufacturer. Overall the loops are well made but my experience was a headache!
__label__1 Don't Try This Album at Home: Needless to say, His playing is nothing spectacular.His fusion experiment lyrically blew up in his face. This is an overratted album that I would not recommend to any JAZZ lover. On the left hand his "Tales from the Hudson" is a good modern era album. His flawless technique and great sidesmen keep the Album flowin'.
__label__2 The Best Of The DMC series!: This game is way better than the other games in every way. If you were a fan of the other games then you will definately love this game.The graphics are better and the controls( though they'vechanged a little bit) are easy to get used to.The biggest downfall the game has is that you do not start out playing as Dante, but some new kid named Nero. However, once you start playing as Nero you'll find out just how cool he is too. In some of the gaming mags I've read the reviewers liked playing Nero more than Dante. I personally like playing Dante more, but hey, Nero is still very cool.The only other thing left to say about the game is that it's a true DMC game. The story and attitude of the characters are all there. The beautiful women and strange demons are in the game too. If you own a PS3 then buy this game. If you are getting a PS3 then get this game. If you own a XBox 360, then this is the only good game you can play!!!!
__label__1 A little stiff: I ordered this bedroom set because my son loves anything truck related! I wanted to get him interested in his new "big boy" toddler bed. It worked. He likes the trucks on the sheets and will point them out and name them. However the sheets are a little rough. The comforter itself is very cute but also rough and stiff. I'm hoping that if I keep washing it it will soften up. It's just one of those blankets that when you put it over someone it stays in the same shape until you bring it closer to you. At this point my son uses a different blanket when he goes to bed. One that is much softer and lays over him completely with out creating little air vents. I love the look of the set but was disapointed with the quality of it. Maybe it'll get better with washing.
__label__2 A trip back to my past!: One of my favorite books, and I also loved the movie. I have been wanting this fine portrayal of the book's charactors for so long, and consider myself lucky to have found it on DVD. The acting is such that I can watch it over and over, and probably will. The transaction was troube free, which is a compliment to the Seller. Thank You!
__label__1 Well, it's ... different.: Keeping an open mind, I was prepared to read an objective work on modern day "cults," which, oddly enough, include almost every world religion. What I found was a completely biased, mean-spirited jab at every belief system that didn't smack of hard-core Christianity. No one, but the most rabid Christian, could possibly find this book interesting, enlightening, or even entertaining. It is an insult that a Baptist minister chooses to wield immaturity and prideful judgement as a weapon against others. His uneducated ramblings are honestly not worth the time and labor used to print this book. Consider this "work" just another incarnation of Bible Belt Trash.
__label__2 An authoritarian on Cults and other religions.: If you are truly a seeker of the truth, this is a book that must be in your library. Have you ever wanted to know why the Seventh Day Adevtise Church is the way it is? Or have you wanted to always know how Islam, Mormons or Jehovah Witnesses got their start? Everything in Walter Martin's book is based upon hard facts found in magazines, court cases and documented sources. This book will open your eyes and make you realize the fabrications that many cults and religions have painstaikingly gone through to create the illusion of what is the truth. Walter Martin's Kingdom of the Cults opens these falsehoods to the light of day and it gives Christians the tools to have intelligent and rational discussions with a person who believes one of these ruses. It is a tantamount book, resourceful, direct and above all it is the truth.
__label__2 Kingdom of the Cults: Excellent and informative book! I was a bit surprised to see that the Seventh Day Adventists are no longer considered a cult in spite of the fact that I know they still are very much focused on the teaching of Ellen G. White.
__label__1 You , too, might be a cultist (if you're not a fundie) !: How are we supposed to tke a book seriously that lumps Islam (a major world religion that inculdes nearly 1/4 of the world's population) in with small fringe groups like the Moonies. It is simply a fact that the world "cult" is only appropriate when used to denote groups that are small, extremely authoritarian (i.e. centered around a strong leader with unchecked power over the members) and outside the maintream of any major tradition. A world religion is by definition not a cult. Niether is a well established liberal Protestant denomination like the Unitarian Church a cult. If any group that is not conservative Protestant is a cult (which seem to be Martin's basic premise), then why doesn't he call Judaism, Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy cults? It would be pretty ridiculous, but it wouldn't make this book any less logical.
__label__2 Sound and Informative: For anyone wanting to know what their friends, acquaintances, co-workers (who are involved in any of these "cults") believe and why this is a clear and informative. It presents the obvious cults of today and the not so obvious. Provides origination and history of each cult and the basics of what they believe then it gives a comparison to what the Bible teaches and how each cult contradicts what the Word is saying. Very helpful for me in understanding where people I know are coming from.
__label__2 Modern mob adventure: This is really an underrated film about a group of criminals working in Los Angeles. The story involves strong loyalty among gang members, but also betrayal and greed by one of its members. Some of the scenes are raw and gripping, and the police are not always angels. Los Angeles comes alive as the focal point for this film, and it's engaging to consider the way criminals devise schemes to rob from the rich and then become emulators of the wealthy.
__label__2 Nice looking magazine rack: Overall, it's a nice looking magazine rack. It's not solid wood, as I expected - it's the type of wood you would expect to see on Target furniture. The metal hardware also broke for me (as it did in the other user's review) - but luckily I had another one on hand. Those parts just aren't very reliable. The price may be a bit high. But I was unable to find a style that I liked as much as this one. Overall, I am pleased with it and it is doing a good job holding all my magazines.
__label__1 Coast to coast fiasco: Arthur, please leave Florida to the likes of Carl Hiaasen or Elmore Leonard. Your novel failed short in its depiction of our favorite state. The cast of characters wasn't excessively long, but the individual storylines were poorly developed. All the coincidences!: the FBI agent who falls for the car-collector woman who sells her red Jaguar to the parents of the teenage bank robber who "killed" a senator with an asthma attack... The vicious and beautiful killer, her lovely parents, her psychic blind daughter... How forced and convoluted. I prefer simpler novels. This is not it.
__label__1 ALASKAN BUYERS DISCRIMATED AGAINST AGAIN: This order clearly stated it could be shipped to the U.S. only which Alaska is part of (when they want our oil) it did not say continental U.S. only. The vendor decided that Alaska did not apply and cancelled the order which was a gift for a loved one which of course did not arrive as scheduled. Clearly this could have shipped United States postal if the vendor was concerned for the customer but in this case it was cancelled after taking their time as well. I would not use any vendor other than Amazon direct. They have never pulled this on me after many many orders sent to Alaska. Beware of this vendor!!!
__label__1 WTH!!!: Recieved the package in a good enough time but the issue was that disc 3 was missing & in it's place was Agent Cody Banks 3, which leads me to believe that it was done intentionally. Emailed the seller twice in hopes to just get the third disc sent out sent my hubby had no issue w/the other discs but seller never responded. Forced to file a claim to get my money back. Highly dissapointed w/the service & dissapointed hubby who of course really wants to watch disc 3 it was the most important disc to him & he doesn't have it. Buyer be ware I will never buy from this seller again.
__label__2 Just one complaint: This game has greatly improved from its previous installments. But there is one thing that continues to annoy me, that is the repetitive game play. The enemies do change quite a bit but you run into similar enemies way more often than you should in my opinion. But the graphics are great all the way around. The new styles and weapons are very fun in every way. Also the story is interesting more so than any of the previous DMC games. I would recommend this game for anyone who wants to enjoy Devil May Cry one last time at its peak. This game is worth a look.
__label__1 Don't buy this product: Many of the reviews here are accurate and valuable. The most important piece of advice is to contact Linksys and see if your printer is supported. Having set the environment up with my HP OfficeJet K60 everything seems fine. When I go to print however, the application recognizes the printer and even knows what port it is connected on. Unfortunately, everything I print goes into a black hole. After calling Linksys support, they tell me that looking through their internal list it shows a number of poor people like myself who have tried and failed to get the K60 working, so they "assume" its not supported.When I asked if I could get a copy of the list indicating what is supported, I was told its an internal only document. So its trial and error if you have this product.Like other reviews, they recommended that I upgrade to the WPS11 server. Although I've been happy with Linksys, I think I'll look elsewhere first.
__label__2 Lots of good ideas: For those moving to the healthy raw vegan diet but stumped about what to make for dinner besides salad, this book contains many great ideas. I was taken by the variety and inventiveness of many of the recipes where various ingredients are combined in very clever ways in order to get not only the flavour but also the correct texture.I particularly like the recipes for raw lasagna, sushi and dolmas. These are great for surprising the non-raw with the possibilities of food in its natural state. The book itself can inspire the non-raw with its professional layout and superb photography.The additional information on how to prepare items such as rejuvelac and cashew 'cheese' are straight forward and easy to follow.Well worth the money.
__label__2 Very convenient and easy to use: This is a good one. Large buttons help operate easily. Size of Numbers is about 1/2 inch for each time display. The audible alert is pleasant to hear. Loud enough for within the room use or nearby. I read the previous reviews and bought this one. I use it for timing practice tests for my kids. Easy directions and pretty sturdy. I use it on a table top, so I have no idea how strong the magent is. Worth the money.
__label__1 Do not buy!: Horrible product. Buttons are too hard to push or ultra-sensitive where the slightest rub and you have triggered something. The display is covered in grime on the inside so that you cannot see the numbers very well. A really garbage product.
__label__2 Wow what a read: This is the first book I have bought on the American civil war, I could not put it down once started, its an easy read with a well written introduction that puts the reader in the correct state on mind before commencing the book.
__label__2 Father now grandfather: Memorized this book reading it to our four children as they grew up and am now giving copies to them for their children.It's a classic.
__label__2 good story: i only gave this a five star because of the way she ended the story. it leaves you hanging. you don't know if she was able to stop her mother from doing this to another little girl. otherwise the book was good. it amazes me what some mothers do to their own children and yet they get away with it.
__label__2 NDS Lite Stand: I've been waiting for this for a while. It's a great idea. My shoulders and hands are less sore. It offers a lot of different angles for your viewing. It offers for both left and right handed players and it even stands vertically for NDS Crosswords game. I would recommend this to anybody with the DS Lite console.
__label__2 True value: reminiscing about past camping days was made possible with a carefully cared for second hand edition of this book that brought enjoyment to a small camp reunion this fall.
__label__1 Good lord! People can publish anything!: Robert thinks that just because he reads something, he can spit it back out. This book by an "expert" is putrid; the care described would be considered abuse by most varanid enthusiasts. Not to mention there are many mislabeled photos etc.I am shocked this got published. It really shows how ignorant the general public is about reptiles... they seem to just accept the information because it is published by a PhD.Reading this, and considering it good is like reading a children's book about a construction company, and trying to builda house with it. Completely wacky info, everything mislabeled, a recipe for disaster. Get Daniel's fantastic Savannah Monitor book instead!
__label__2 Faith Food, a faith-builder!: I have really enjoyed Faith Food. It has strengthened my faith and is a great start to the day. I have bought over 20 copies for friends and family. Kenneth E. Hagin's simplicity in believing the Bible is so refreshing and brings me back to God's promises and His faithfulness. I highly recommend it!Tom Squashic, Pastor
__label__2 It does what it's supposed to: I've read some of the reviews about this product and the biggest complaint seems to be that the head sometimes gets water on the garment. I only get spots when I try and use it on something laid flat because the water condenses in the head. It will also condense in the hose and if the hose drops below the steamer it gurgles. This really is not a tabletop item, it has to be used on the floor. I've used it on just about all my cloths: khakis, polos, button-down shirts and it does a reasonably good job. If I have one complaint about it, it is that the cord is too short. and with the steamer on the floor, it will barely reach the top of an item hung using the over-the-door hook. I also wish it had a way to fill the reservoir (which is only 8 oz.) with out removing the hose. Overall, I think for the price that I paid, I got my moneys worth, after all it's just a tea kettle with a hose.
__label__1 Steamer to spurter-: Worked well for first couple of months, but then just spews out spurts of water with a little steam.
__label__1 Not Very Impressed: After reading the reviews below, I was looking forward to having an effective, cheap steamer on hand. However, this Conair doesn't do the job. It starts emitting steam quickly but the steam had little impact on the condition of my dress shirts and suits. To get even modest results, I had to tug on the fabric to pull the wrinkles out. GIven the time and effort it takes, I'd rather just iron.
__label__2 worth the price.: It is not bad if you just need a steamer for your dresses, and it's perfect for temporary use like me. But if you want to keep a long lasting one at home, you'd better spend more money and choose a better one~ this is not that good when using, but I should say, what do you expect from a $25 steamer?~ it's farely good, especially for the price.
__label__1 Steamer: I bought this because I thought ironing was too much of a chore. This thing is too much of a hassle for the results. It works better on thinner fabrics and it's good to have around for delicate pieces, though.
__label__1 Not international usage: It stopped working after 10 minutes, i think it burend....I asume now it was not design for internation use, because I used it on 220 voltage!
__label__2 works for us: It does its job. Just remember to always throw out the unused water from the tank to prevent mold.
__label__1 Not worth it: I got this product thinking that it would replace my iron and ironing board - I was wrong! It is not strong enough to take the wrinkles out of khaki pants or oxford shirts that are a cotton/polyester blend. The clothes do not hold their shape either. It took me longer to steam a pair of pants than it would have for me to just iron them because of how you have to tough at the pants to make the fabric straight for the steamer. I guess I was looking for an easy way out of ironing and this product was definitely not it!
__label__1 Don't waste your time: Conair steamer does not work very well. I think I can get a better steam in the shower. You might be able to do a shirt in half an hour if you're lucky. Trust me. Don't waste your time with this item.
__label__1 not so good: I read the same complaints and thought the same thing DUH, read instructions but the first three x it seemed ok, now it is spitting and very awkward, and takes a long time to get steam going.I am looking for a new one.
__label__1 Not impressed: #1 It does not put out enough steam and #2 it does not have a steam switch/button to release the steam or not release stem...instead it is continual steam...but it's paltry.I returned it--It did not do a better job than the pressure water spray bottle I have been using to finely mist my clothes (which works great)
__label__1 Not good: This game has confusing graphics, the play-control is horrible, and the game is too repetitive.
__label__1 eh..: this bra is disappointing. I was so excited to get it after all of the great reviews. I think that it would be a great bra for smaller chested women. i have always been a 34D, and now after my first pregnancy-currently nursing a 6 month old, I'm a 34-36DD/E. This bra is just a thin piece of material in front, which is hard to tell from just online pictures. I have wanted to return mine, but am not sure if it's too late or not. I just hate spending so much money on a bra that I'm so unhappy with. I did also purchase the bella materna padded nursing bra, and it is fabulous! i wear it all the time, practically everyday, and it is so comfortable and has held up incredibly well. So, I hate to be a debbie downer, but the maternelle is just not the best for larger chested women. :-/
__label__2 This REALLY works!: Another successful "potty" story -- medication and side effects of an illness left me highly irregular. Research brought me to magnesium citrate. I trust Solgar and buy it when possible for other vitamins. Three months later, two pills, and I can attest to being a 100x better. what a relief!
__label__2 Excellent Resource: I found this atlas to be an excellent resource for my college World Civilization Class. I would recommend it for anyone who has an interest in, or is a history student.
__label__1 Very poor product: This is by far the worst dual cassette deck that I have ever purchased. The play back and record have very poor sound quality. The tapes regardless of what kind, do not play at the right speed, in other words they play slower then other tape decks.Very unhappy.
__label__1 Good Product: This is an excellent cassette deck. It works as it should, i.e., it plays and records music very well.
__label__1 disappointing: Well I never knew what a "shooter on rails" was until i got this game. Its not as much fun to play as the previous one because you only aim and shoot. YOu don't control where your character goes. It gets old quick too. I'm not sure I would recommend it even for a rental and the graphics are not too impressive but its a wii game so that goes without saying.
__label__1 Big Dissapointment: After waiting for the game for some time, i am very dissapointed with what i have seen. The arcade style, where you don't have much control over you're character is very annoying. Compared to RE4 this is a very bad game. The only thing that would make me play it is that i love Resident Evil. Unless you are a big fan of resident evil or enjoy playing arcade games; don't consider this game.
__label__1 Complete Deparature from Everything Good in Resident Evil series: We were so excited to buy this game we bought it the day it came out without reading any reviews. Big mistake! We had loved all the other Resident Evil games so much that we had faith this one would also be great. You cannot even control the characters in the game and it's basically just target practice for you and your Wii controller. None of the story line is new. It's all scenes from previous games. Our favorite aspect of previous Resident Evil games is the puzzle-like quality where you need to collect things and figure out how to use them later on in the game. This game required no thinking whatsoever. Very disappointing. $50 down the drain for 15 minutes of disappointment.
__label__1 Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles: This one is like Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles you need to be young to play it and keep up. Not free form like 4 resident evil, which is way, way better
__label__2 Zombie-killing fun!: This game is really fun! I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil movie series, but this is the first RE game I've purchased. It's a fun on-rails shooter game that is sufficiently challenging without being too frustrating. Plus, it has Jill Valentine, who is just the coolest character ever.
__label__2 FUN@!: My son really enjoyed this game. Came as described, would buy from this seller again. Thank you!
__label__2 An interesting experience: A very challenging game wich requires a lot of reflexes and a good aiming arm.
__label__2 Great story and so different!: I really loved this story as it was so different. It led me to looking for more information about the Knights Templar. Read a Virginia Henley book also "Desired" that told more about them. Like others I would love to read a sequel about Kadar and Selene....Please!!
__label__1 Drab and Boring: This is really one of the worst games yet for the PlayStation 2. There are obnoxious clipping and camera-angle problems which make fighting and exploring a chore, and the graphics are drab and boring - not what one would expect for a PlayStation 2 game. Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss.
__label__1 Pretentious dreck!: When will composers learn that the string quartet is not an effective medium for heroic themes? These composers have far to go.
__label__1 Yet another unnecessary sequel: While the story is entertaining and readable, the use of P&P characters is quite unnecessary and somewhat distracting. The development of characters reads more like the inspiration came from the BBC mini series than from the novel. Furthermore, the sound of the dialogue is more often than not strictly modern. Who coiuld ever believe the Darcy's would get caught up in something like this!
__label__1 Plot was lame. Started OK but no other redeeming features.: As other reviewers describe, the language is not period (or British) and the plot is horrid. Anachronisms all over the place, especially in the newly introduced characters. The American characters and the Black Magic themes do not work at all.I agree with the reviewers who found the beginning of the book mildly intriguing, with a nice relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth. The book goes downhill from the point when the Darcys discover the newly married Caroline (Bingley) walking in the gutter in the middle of the night.The characterizations of the original P&P; characters are good, the settings and wit are mostly acceptable, but none are excellent or inspiring enough to even begin to overcome the plot deficiencies.This one a loser. I edited my review and gave "Pride and Prescience" a second star after reading an even worse P&P; sequal, "Desire and Duty". At least "Pride and Prescience" had a mildly interesting beginning.
__label__1 Interesting, but full of errors: This is a great book if you want a very brief history of fire engine manufacturers from around the world. However, it is riddled with errors regarding U.S. manufacturers. For instance, it shows a photo of a Mount Horeb, Wisconsin fire truck and claims it's in Canada. The authors do not seem to know that Crown Firecoach went out of business in the '80s and Pirsch did so in the '90s. The coverage of Pierce is pathetically short given its prominence in the U.S. market. If I can find these errors about U.S. companies in just five minutes, one can only wonder how many more there for manufacturers from other countries that I have much less knowledge of. Overall, a disappointing book. Since mine was defective (cut off corner) I will be returning it and will not order a replacement.
__label__2 Special edition: Special edition has some cool (but useless) things, but the game is the same old stuff you've experienced in its prequels.
__label__1 Horrible: This game was not only horrible, but it was too easy. I beat the game in less than two hours, and never played it again. I do not intend on buying any other Army Men games anytime soon. It was a complete waste of money, and I hope I can stop you from buying it.
__label__2 Appealing Second Book: I love Huskey's sense of humor and tragic life like stories. Once I read the first book I couldn't wait to read this one. I love her style of writing.
__label__2 Good Wetsuit: This wetsuit worked great and was easy to get on our 15 month old but slippery when wet. However it did provide a better grip than without it on. Overall, I would recommend.
__label__1 Don't buy this book if you bought the first edition: I bought the first edition and was happy. THinking I could update my skill, i bought the second edition but was disappointed because there was virtually nothing new. The second edition has an additional author, but looks like that is the only addition to the second edition.Disappointed
__label__2 Acoustic Japanese folk: Compilation of traditional folk dance music selections (with vocals) from various parts of Japan. (Some of these tracks are on other CDs in the "Music of Japanese People" series.) These are more source type recordings, although not field recordings. But if one wants to get to the roots of the type of music which people like Shoukichi Kina, Nenes, etc. have electrified and modernized, this is good stuff.
__label__1 Same writer, same voice: I am a long time CCR/Fogerty fan. Have all the CCR studio CDs & numerous Fogerty CDs. This is a good collection of John's CCR & solo works. I can understand the 'LIVE' recordings of Almost Saturday Night & Rockin All Over The World from Premonition, but the other LIVE cuts should have been the studio versions. Also, 2 versions of Fortunate Son is a waste & a few songs missing. I enjoy Change In The Weather from Eye of the Zombie & Walking in a Hurricaine from Blue Moon Swamp. All in all, a good CD.
__label__2 Go on and cry: Bloodstones from my hometown of Kansas City,Missouri. There the last of the great R&B harmony groups and they are one of the best.We go a long way back is a pure hennesy drinkin,dim lights classic. The true treasure on this cd is the song "Go on and cry ". Here's a great line from that classic--" I had to go to the best friend I had-and that was my mother". A must have cd for the serious R&B group harmony collector of groups from the 70's and 80's.
__label__1 MURDER SHE WROTE and wrote, and wrote, and wrote ...: Reruns of "Murder She Wrote" on cable TV were good for one thing - power naps after work. The episodes put me to sleep every time. I have yet to master the art of falling asleep while reading. The book is dull, routine, and dumb, just like the tv show, but not without that addictive pulp fiction downgraded IQ quality that keeps the pages turning. The resolution is a major let down, like a cold, burnt match concluding the final chapter. When my elderly grandmother died I inherited (took) her boxes of paperback mysteries, which certainly would have been tossed away by less inclined members of my family, mostly classics of the genre and the oddball title like this, based on the popular tv show. Assuming she had read this well-thumbed copy, I'm hoping gramma wasn't bored to, ahem, tears.
__label__2 Good for Stay- At - Home Phones: Me and my Mp3 player, are everywhere around town. So I am constantly looking for good headphones. I have had 3 pair scince I got the Mp3 player 6 pair combined with the old cd player. When I got these I thought they were awsome at first. True they sound great, true they are comfortable, but they are by now means durable. I droped them once in a bathroom, and the fall to the floor, cracked the inside plastic, facing the ear on the headband. So I took it home fixed it and then they got droped again. The "C" claw that pivots the headphone, broke. Each time I tried to fix it it was to no avail. The one other thing I will give to it's credit, it that it does fold up. If you like headphones that you can really shut out the rest of the world with and then when you need to do some talking and put your phones away, these will fold up neatly into a jacket pocket. If you buy them, try not to love them too much, cuz they won't love you back.
__label__1 This is only the English paperback of Ch. 3: Be wary of this listing! It is NOT the hardcover of the original volume! Instead, it is a paperback (albeit in good condition) of the English translation of Boldt's chapter 3. This should have been a classic of German dressage, but instead is an expensive drop in the bucket. The paperback listing only comes up after you navigate to several layers of this site. BUYERS BEWARE!!!
__label__1 Dire picture quality!: Even for the die-hard collector of ballet films, Anna Karenina is a dubious investment. As other reviewers have said, the picture quality of this VAI release is terrible - dark, grainy and full of filmic flickers and sparkles. Recommended for fans of Maya Plisetskaya only. For other fans of ballet, save your money on this one.
__label__1 Study Guide for the Therapeutic Recreation Specialist Examination: This product was very unhelpful because all of the answers were written next to each question. In order to take the practice exams I had to white-out every answer on every page and it was a pain!!!
__label__2 Excellent reference: This book contains good descriptions and excellent photographs which makes it an outstanding reference for identification.
__label__1 A Big Slice of Cheese: These speakers are cheesy....I had some other speakers made by the same company and they lasted for about 5 years. Travel can be rough but they hung in there with me. They were great slim had a nice case so I went with the same company...mistake...not as good as my first. If you are just looking for something to sit close they do their job. Keeping in mind these are for travel so expect sound limitation. I got the adapter; unless you want speakers right next to you, not a good option, cord needs to be longer or go blue tooth...hint hint....
__label__2 Great buy!: Great price for a great product. Arrived in timely fashion and worked exactly as promised. Absolutely no problems.
__label__2 Worth it: I had the Philips SBC-HP140 for roughly 4 years, great set of phones. I bought the HP170 to replace them at home, and they've been great the past 6 months. I now need 'phones for my lab, and I have no hesitation in plumping for these again - they're a worthy successor to my excellent 140s. Highly recommend. I'd give 'em 4.5 stars.
__label__1 Terrible: I bought these headphones because i was impressed with the specs for the cheap price. I later realized that these headphones have a cheap price for a reason. They are not durable. They do not cancel any sound. and they just all around suck. Dont not buy these headphones for any reason whatsoever. I recommend the Senneheiser 212 Pro model headphones for a much better quality and sound.
__label__1 Sonic Impact: The product was faulty. One of the springs in the battery compartment was broken off, so it will not hold the batteries properly.
__label__1 Waste Of time: I bought this mini amp to power my 2 20 watts speakers and it never worked, don't waste your monies as its nothing more then a toy.
__label__2 A Sociological Masterpiece-or a Disaster: I ran into this book in 1982, when I transferred from a small college to a major university-not because I wanted to be Preppy, but because how it had absolutely consumed the majority of the student body to BE as Prep as possible-and it couldn't be avoided, no matter how hard one tried to ignore it. While the book was meant to be somewhat satirical, the impact it had was huge at that time, increasing and encouraging an already present 'us VS them' mindset that I think persists to this day. It's a good book nonetheless, and I'm surprised that a updated/revised version hasn't come out by now. But I shudder at the possible impact that would have.
__label__1 Where is the market maker?: Seeing the book title, I had hoped to read about trading from the view of a market maker. To my disappointment, this book could have been written by anyone: it's just like many other books on trading. Nothing in the book is a special contribution from a market maker. This is, of course, understandable: why would a market maker reveal his secret of how to make money and beat the traders and the public with his profession? But then, don't make a misleading title, since you are writing the book just as any other author on trading.
__label__1 It wasn't about the Alamo....: Very disappointing. We bought this video for my son prior to making a trip to the Alamo. After previewing it, we didn't even bother to show it to him. That said, if you want to learn about the native Tejanos or Mexicans that lived in Texas than this might be what you are looking for, but otherwise the movie really didn't talk about the history of the Alamo. If you want to learn about the Alamo look elsewhere.... We were very disappointed with this DVD.
__label__1 Bad customer service: I ordered this book and realized the day after I placed the order that my boyfriend had bought it for himself. When I emailed the seller to see if it was too late to cancel my order and the reason I got no response. I sent another email 2 days later and I still never received a response. I then got the book (which I'm stuck with) and not even in good condition! BAD EXPERIENCE.
__label__1 it's a downgrade: vista is a great example of bloatware, my laptop came with vista and it was really slow for a 2Ghz cpu with 2GB of ram.The interface reduced my productivity.I got really annoyed when it kept asking me to enter the admin password for anything i wanted to do.The battery was supposed to last 1 hour but lasted less than that.I tried making a copy of a dvd and it wouldnt let me.Some software of the software i use was not compatible with it.It totaly sucks. I had to upgrade back to windows xp with a dual boot to ubuntu which has nicer desktop graphics than vista.
__label__1 too many drivers missing: I like Microsoft, but Vista makes the use of my computer so limited. I use 2 computers one with XP and one with Vista. I try to put everything on the Vista computer, but now have 4 programs that won't work on Vista and therefore I need 2 computers on my desk. I would immediately go back to XP on this computer, but right now I don't have the time. Until drivers are updated on more programs I recommend using XP
__label__1 The worst I have ever seen!: Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.
__label__1 Vista an XP Pro Service pack.: As far as I'm concerned Microsoft could have made a service pack 3 or 4 for windows XP Pro. Then you could apply the patches needed to run the upgrade. As far as I'm concerned Microsoft is out just to make money. Thats all they care about. Windows XP Pro will be my last windows os, I myself will be changing over to Lenix OS. I can't belive that Microsoft went to all this trouble to make Vista. With all the different versions to boot. People if you want to upgrade to Vista be my guest. Microsoft can have and keep their Vista OS. I am removing mine and reinstalling XP Pro until I do my change over to Lenix OS. I will never purchase a new computer with Vista on it.
__label__1 HORRIBLE DO NOT GET VISTA!!!: ABSOLUTELY THE WORST OPERATING SYSTEM EVER CREATED!!! DO NOT GET VISTA FOR ANYTHING!! IT IS FULL OF GLITCHES. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE MICROSOFT ADS!! Your computer WILL freeze, it WILL crash, and be 10 times slower! Vista also leaves your computer completely open to viruses and spyware.The windows 95 was a better operating system. VISTA CONVINCED ME TO FINALLY GET A MAC, WHICH WAS BY FAR THE BEST COMPUTER BUYING DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE! The mac operating system is completely user friendly, fast, no crashes, and NO VIRUSES!!! It's just so better organized... and with no glitches to report yet. PLUS, IT'S READY TO USE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!!DO NOT GET VISTA, GET A MAC!!!
__label__1 Nothing but problems: Purchased this up-grade and had so many problems I have removed it from my computer. Caused problems with my HP scanner/printer, with I-Tunes and my I-pod to name a some of the trouble. Don't buy unless u have many hours to waste on attempted fixes and back door action to do any work
__label__1 Wait if you can: If you will be purchasing a computer in the next year I would recommend that you wait to buy Vista. Purchase your next pc with it installed and you may save yourself a lot of aggrevation and head aches. My installation was horrific and made my other PC unusable for many hours and many hours of my time to get working.
__label__1 Let off some steam Bennett!: Working at a bookstore, one gets to see all the really nifty right-wing books that come in, books from the insatiable Ann Coulter to the rotund William Bennett. Of course, these books are prominently displayed, as the right-wing will go into hysterics if they were not and cry "LIBERAL CABAL!!!"The Gambler Bennett, well, he's broke even with his new manual on how to convince the world on the need to end moral decline once and for all in the United States, especially after the wretched events of 9/11. And of course, The Gambler has all the answers to our problems. But, as Spencer Tracy says to Fredric March in the classic 1960 film "Inherit The Wind", "It's a shame we don't all possess your positive knowledge of what is right and what is wrong, Mr. Brady."
__label__1 Elites never sacrifice.: In this book Mr. Bennett says "Many of us have forgotten what we once knew about our freedoms and our decencies, and we have forgotten why, time and time again, we have had to rally ourselves to the point of ultimate sacrifice to defend them,"Mr. Bennett never describes what these decencies are. For example, gambling is legal but many find this distasteful so is gambling not a decent thing to do? T But the big fault I have with this book is that Mr. Bennett tells us that we must sacrifice but Mr. Bennett has not sacrificed by serving in the military which for me makes him appear to be an elitist.
__label__1 Very Safe: I have put fuel into these cans and cannot return them; so am stuck with them. I purchased several metal fuel cans in assorted sizes for both gas and diesel. What these pictures do not show is it is virtually impossible to put your chosen fuel into these cans. You need at least four hands and maybe more for the larger size cans. After my first time of trying to fill my mower from the one gallon can I realized the assorted safety virtues are there for those people who have no clue. Kind of like the ones who designed the can I suppose, unless the whole idea is if you can't get fuel into the can, you are safe. People whose hands are small have a hard time with these cans, people with large hands may have it easier. I spilled nearly the entire gallon when filling my mower, back to plastic I think. If I ever find an older metal can at a yard sale I will be much happier.
__label__1 Performance Now 4.0: I was not happy with this software because I couldn't even load it. I got an error everytime I loaded it and I had tried to load on another computer as well and got the same result. I had to return the product for a return. I was not satisfified with my purchase at all.
__label__1 Does not work with NB-2LH Canon Rebel XT battery: I'm not sure if I'm a special case or not, but my battery fits into the charger, and it plugs in and the lights flash and everything, however when I pop the battery back into the camera after a long charge, nothing.To make sure that the problem was the charger not the battery, I tried charging the battery with a friends charger who has the same camera. Voila, no problem.Again, I'm not sure if I have a defective model, and I appreciate the company offering an affordable model, however this turned out not to be a viable option for me.
__label__1 less than thrilled: My product got lost in the mail, which come to find out is not that uncommon with Eastbay. When I called to report what had happened, I found out that they were out of my husband's size. Needless to say, I had to get him the next size up and it was way too big. In their defense, they did mail me the replacement free of charge through rush shipping.
__label__2 Good Intense Yoga workout: I have a number of yoga videos, but this is the one I use to work out. Mark has a wonderful intensity and enthusiasm, and the workout is at a high level. Not really for beginners, but very good for anyone who wants to extend their yoga experience. Very nice!
__label__2 Tuna Flavored Laxatone Remedy for Hairballs: I know a lot of people use petrolatum for hairballs, but my cat prefers the tuna flavored laxatone. She is, of course, a cat and a very finicky one at that. The tuna flavor makes it more a 'treat' for her, which makes it easy for me to administer it.
__label__2 Wonderful book: I love all of the Cape Light Books. I hope there will be more than 8. They are so relaxing to read, and they make you feel like you really know all the people. They bring in the Christian parts of the book and make you feel so much closer to God. I love the books so much.
__label__1 too much repetition: Seems like the 3 authors wrote this book without communication amongst each other. There is a lot of repetition, this book is over 600 pages and could be summarized in 100pages. In each chapter you re-read over and over again the stuff you've just read.It is also quite elementary...the quizz at the end of each chapter are really basic and nothing like the MCQ you get in a college class...The good point is that there are a lot of examples.
__label__2 AAA++++ Seller: Superfast Delivery. Product was in condition as promised, covers and pagers were completely in tact and undamaged. This particular book had an excessive amount of distracting highlighting marks in it, but I'm sure this was a rare exception. I would definitely do business with this seller again.
__label__2 MRS. PARKS DOES IT AGAIN: ELECTA ROME PARKS DELIVERS ANOTHER PAGE TURNER IN ALMOST DOESN'T COUNT. THIS BOOK IS A GREAT READ WITH UNEXPEXTED PLOT TWISTS THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE.
__label__1 Caution! Sinnerman runs 10+ mins! ("POWER...."etc): Liked the movie so I wanted to get the soundtrack, BUT it doesn't play well for me as a regular listenable CD: relatively short (38min CD) and Sinnerman is the WHOLE song (you'll hear "POWER" more than you wish for! I dare you to count! The snippets in the movie are easier to take). Conti's instrumentals are lumped at the end and run short and repetitive. Can't say I listen to this much, but have been thinking of just taping the parts I like. :(
__label__1 Ticked about the lack of stuff here: The whole problem with the Soundtrack is that the "nice" stuff, the stuff that made the movie feel "ritzy" and glamourous, the jazz and the piano, the Sting soundtrack and the rest of the stuff is here. But the music that rounded out the whole movie itself, such as the song from the lovemaking scene between Russo and Brosnson, is NOT here. The music from the original heist is not here. Hell, half the music from the whole thing isn't here. Which makes this, while a nice CD to listen to, NOT what I'd even want to buy. I listened to it, I returned it to the rack, and I walked out. I wouldn't buy it, and MGM better start figuring out the amount of space that a CD actually has, and what is DECENT music to listen to, and what is not.Welcome to the digital world, RIAA.
__label__2 Thomas Crown Affair Soundtract: The CD was brand new, and I love the songs, it came in the mail extremley fast, even though it was a week before Christmas.
__label__1 Worked great...for a while: I have had mine for a few years and it worked great. Now the female end is leaking like crazy and of course, there is no way to repair this.I contacted Melnor, their name was on this and they gave me a "bum rush" regarding this and disavowed any responsibility...sort of odd, since their BRAND name is on it. So, I guess this goes to the dump.Don't waste your money if you are expecting this to work long term.
__label__2 The best book in it's field.: This is a book that all students of Intrnational Politics and International Relations should have on their shelves.Professors Smith and Baylis have managed to create the finest textbook ever written on the subject, it is put together in such a way that it is both easy to use and full of relavant in-depth information. Very highly recommended.
__label__1 DOES NOT WORK: I bought one and it never worked right. Bought it at Office Depot, they would not replce after 30 days, so I shipped to Brother and they sent me another- it didn't work right either. My guess is the networking setup just doesn't work. Can't scan, or print labels or envelopes.Called Brother back and they wouldn't do anything more, so I just had to replace at my own cost
__label__1 Ink consumption is the only drawback here.......: The people who rave on this item do so because they have not replaced ink yet or got it for around $100.00. I paid a little more than a $100.00 and let me tell you that I am disappointed in the fact that I had to buy a complete ink set about six months ago and have had maybe 10 black and white faxes faxed to me. I was expecting an important fax today and suprise! I cant recieve it because cyan is out! These cartridges cost an arm and a leg too, almost sixty bucks (full set). I am going to break my own creed and now go to cartridge world. If I refill with brother ink one more time (full set), it will be more than I paid for the machine.The machine is sturdy and works great........just a money pit when it comes to ink. Damn glad I don't have to use color.
__label__1 waste of money: I started reading this book a few days ago because I wanted to learn more about the life of Mata Hari, but the author talks about other topics instead of the main subject.I don't really recommend this book unless you wanna know more about other topics that are NOT related to Mata Hari.
__label__1 Absolutely useless!: This atlas was absolutely useless during our trip to Ireland. It did NOT provide detailed maps of the cities, and the layout and organization was horrible! The free map we got from the Rental Car Agency was of more use than this atlas. Do NOT buy this product!
__label__2 great music comp: I followed the story on tv and wanted to buy the music ever since. Glad I found it. I would recommend it to anyone.
__label__1 It was butchered!!! Cliff is turning over in his grave.: I liked "Mash-up", but I love Metallica. The first 10 seconds I thought I was going to sick. SICK! I hated it. You can't mess with perfection, period! I wouldn't even give this album a single star, all the songs were butchered. Man, Cliff must be turning over in his grave.
__label__1 gardener tool: not powerful enough for most shrubs or bushes in my garden. charge doesnot last long either
__label__2 american gardener: this is the second shear i have purchased. the old one was good except the battery didnt hold a good charge after about 2 years. hope this ones better!!
__label__1 Disappointing: There is nothing new in this book. Its like a collection of bits from all the other books I've read. It seems to tread carefully around the important issues in adoption.I am very disappointed with it.
__label__1 Do not waste your time: I have read many of Amis's books and have enjoyed most of them immensely. This is one that up until now I have missed and I wish I had kept it that way. A feeble attempt at an American style mystery novel with a weak plot line, no beleivable character development and a ending which is effectively non existent. This is a book that is Amis going through the motions to pick up his pay check - do not buy this even if you are a fan of his work.
__label__1 Moves along well. . .but to where?: Nicely written mystery (police procedural variety but without any real knowledge of police work). Unfortunately (for me), when I finished it (I read the last chapter twice) I couldn't figure out the answer. If anyone can help, please let me know--did she or didn't she and, if she didn't, who did?
__label__1 not the greatest thing: Well when i got this book i thought that there was going to be more action in it. But it is just a story about a girl who did suicide (i am not done with it yet). This book also has to many swears in it, no one talks like that, only teens do (that are immature). I can't wait to be done with this book.
__label__2 English Rose was a compelling follow up (in North America) to their excellent debut: English Rose finds Fleetwood Mac adding Danny Kirwan, a third guitarist, to the line-up. Horns also appear for the first time. Other than that this LP is a natural follow up to the band's excellent Chicago blues debut. Standouts are Kirwan's Something Inside of Me and Without You and, of course, the three Peter Green classics, Love That Burns, Albatross and Black Magic Woman. As one listens to Green wail on Magic it becomes crystal clear why both BB and Eric consider him to be one of the great guitarists.Had Fleetwood Mac not morphed into a mega pop band in 1976 they would still have occupied a significant position in the history of English blues. This version of the band was a supremely talented and confident gathering of musicians and as much as I enjoyed Fleetwood Mac when it became the biggest band in the world I have more affection for the various 1968-1973 versions.
__label__2 Top 5 Westerns Ever Written: I have read this book 10 times for the last 30 years. Each time is fresh and new. Historically accurate and a darn good yarn. Deserves to be kept on the shelf with "The Daybreakers" by Louis L'mour and "The Bubbling Spring" by Ross Santee.
__label__1 Jesus was born at the end of the year 2 BC.: All old Church fathers except one report that Jesus was born at the end of the year 2 B.C. And the Catholic Council of Vatican I in 1870 said, when there is a problem in the church, on which the church never gave a decision, then you have to look what the old church fathers say to it. That opinion or the majority of it has to be accepted as the proper answer. Second there is the problem with the wrongly dated death of Herod - he died in 1 BC and not in 4 BC. Furthermore there is the Quirinius-Problem. As Jack Finegan in his Handbook of Biblical Chronology (Princeton 1964) wrote, Sulpicius Quirinius was ruling in 3 and 2 BC. This would fit with the church fathers. The astronomical question: Much closer conjunctions we had in August 12, 3 BC, in June 17, 2 BC and in August 27, 2 BC. And on December 25, 2 BC Jupiter stood without a move in the middle of virgin. Therefore this book missed to give a true answer on the problem.
__label__1 Promises a lot and delivers very little: This book has been hyped up as being the definitive text for Microsoft CRM. In reality it delivers very little. While offering more than the dummies guide to CRM any user can gain more insight into the application using the docs supplied with CRM such as the implementation guide and also just by using the applicationStill waiting for an intermediate to advanced text on Microsoft CRM
__label__1 This book's sell-by date has long since passed: I don't think anybody is still using Microsoft CRM version 1.0, so be sure the title you choose covers the version of CRM you need, which is probably version 3 or 4 at this date.
__label__2 Tomás Cruz a Cuban Legend: Vol. 1 starts assuming that you have never played the congas or have had any previous knowledge of how to play. I found this book and DVD very helpful even though much of it is basic, I discovered that I had learned certain movements incorrectly and was able to correct myself by viewing the DVD. You will also learn Basic exercises and rudiments that are very helpful in improving your speed. however remember that this is a 3 volume series and book number 2 and 3 are crucial to further your learning process.It is my opinion that If you want to learn to play a Cuban instrument you should learn from a Cuban not a person who just studied in Cuba a few times. Tomas is educated and born in Havana. I highly recommend this book you can not imagine how much I have learned from it, as I play people can tell how much better I sound after using this method.
__label__2 Beautiful: Hirts Garden must have packed little elves along with my lava plant to protect it. I thought I made a mistake and ordered a fake plant! That's how wonderful it is. I have my eye on more from Hirts Garden, thank you.
__label__1 words words words...: This book isn't about one man's love of the open road, it's a paean to his love for his own voice as we are interminably subjected to his rambling, circular, paisley stylings. Somewhere near the beginning of the book, he mentioned that we, unlike his family, had the advantage of being able to put the book aside as a break, which not only made me put the book down many, many times but made me want to stage an intervention for his obviously long-suffering family.
__label__1 Ugh.: This book was painful to finish. I kept hoping that it would get better (it didn't). As others have mentioned, there were too many storylines that were completely undeveloped, apparently in a deliberate attempt to get you to read prequels and sequels.However, the worst part of the book for me was the "character" of Bayleigh Stewart, a/k/a "Shadow." Her character was completely annoying, as she seemed to behave completely inconsistently and irrationally. For example, when a misunderstanding arises between Bayleigh and the hero, Long Quiet, rather than explain her situation and clear up all the problems, Bayleigh keeps "forgetting" to talk to him, or missing her opportunity. Very clumsily handled overall; none of the characters are believable in their motivations or behaviors.Also, no author should use the word "manroot" in what is intended to be a serious love scene. I actually laughed out loud.
__label__1 Nothing Outstanding: Frankly, for a book on how to buy RV's, I was disappointed. In one of his chapters on what to advoid, Don launches into a multipaged bashing of two ethnic clans that hustle unsuspecting people with sales of poorly constructed RV that are made in IN. This was not advice, it was pure racism.
__label__1 Not as advertised: This is advertised as Linda Eder and Barbara Streisand's CD. It is only the music and not these two wonderful artists singing.
__label__1 impulse buy: I quickly ordered 3 of these as gifts without realizing that they were only instrumental karaoke type CDs. Thank goodness that I was able to retrieve 2 out of the 3 before they were opened. I had to return them but did keep one that was opened. Disappointment!
__label__1 Is this serious?: I will be the first to say that Girl Talk's "Night Ripper" is simply incredible, and it never seizes to amaze me everytime I listen to it, which is approaching the thousands.This obsession led to a understandable Girl Talk high, prompting me to order this album.To be honest, I spent the first hour of owning it testing the CD in every disc playing device I owned, making sure that my ears weren't deceiving me. I was convinced the disc was severely scratched or damaged. However, I was completely wrong. The tracks are supposed to be like that.One of the most annoying things I can think of is a cd skipping, killing a mood. This entire album is intentionally like that, and it's repulsing.Purchase Night Ripper, which is nearly perfect, but under no circumstances purchase this album.
__label__1 Girl Talk - Secret Diary: SECRET DIARY is Girl Talk in embryonic form -- the mash-ups here are more akin to Kid606 than the smooth segues that Girl Talk would be known for, so things sound a little rough. 2 Unlimited's "Get Ready for This" crashes into on "Let's Start This Party Right," while "I Want You Back" seems to be a grab bag of chopped vocals without much direction... at least until the MJ appears. The album is unabashedly glitchy and washes out some samples in layers of noise, such that there's barely anything recognizable on "Ffun Have To" or "Time to Get Glamourous." He does show his sense of humor in juxtaposition on "What If...", however, smooshing Joan Osborne with some ghetto rap. It's 50% more sacrilegious! The New Kids on the Block get similar treatment on "The Right Stuff." Elsewhere, the Price is Right theme gets mangled on "Unicorn vs. Gravity" and Destiny's Child is whupped on "Jumpin(g)." You can see the seeds here, but they've not yet sprouted.
__label__1 NOT the Girl Talk you're used to: In fact this is pretty much like others have said. Unlistenable - a bunch of almost random noises and samples pasted together in mish-mash fasion with little thought. I could author a better album by taking digital video of my cat using the litter box and converting the video signals to digital sound samples. In fact, I may just go do that right now, it would be a better use of my time than listening to this cat crap.
__label__1 Think twice: First price was steep for one piece. Second... A lil false advertising. They show you a multi-piece set and only ship you one. So please think first before you buy!
__label__2 Great, basic GPS...: If you want a GPS that will tell you where to turn left to get on the Turnpike, this isn't it. But if you want to know exactly where you are on the planet, the Magellan 310 and 315 do an excellent job of it, with full 12-channel satellite tracking, the highest available. The nobs are complicated at first, but most guys like learning that sort of thing. This is basically the perfect gift for geeky dads or hikers.BTW, the screen on the 310 and 315 as well as the features are superior to the eTrex basic model, although that model is far more ergonomic.
__label__2 Not Getting Lost In My Backyard! Or on the Back Roads.: Just using the electronic moving compass feature helped plot out the boundaries of my lot of land. When I found all the corners, the Lat&Long; feature let me place marker post for a fence. It would be good/better if the altitude feature was more accurate, I could use it to make a topographical map of my land too. The reading I do get are just estimates (+/-40 ft).While on trips out of town, or out of state, having been to my destination at least once in the past w/ my 310, I can use the ETA feature(Estimate Time of Arrival) for getting there or coming back home.The 100 landmarks storage memory is well enough for my use. I have added several burger and pizza places to the list for fun.
__label__2 A very good watch: I had this watch for 3 years, until the strap broke, so I bought it again. It has three alarms, which is very useful if you have multiple engagements in a day that you don't want to miss. The timer and the stopwatch are also really useful.
__label__2 exciting plot with unexpected twists: As a mother of 4 boys, I am always looking for books to engage them. The Wreckers takes an exciting topic and adds unexpected twists to the storyline, creating a good deal of reader curiosity. I found it difficult to resist reading "just one more chapter". The adventures that entertwine the two main characters make for a very enjoyable read. As for the unfamiliar shipping terminology the 5th grade teacher reviewer found cumbersome, I thought it added authenticity to the story. This book can be a fairly quick read, and has all the elements of a suspenseful "read-aloud". I have purchased a copy for my 6th grader's teacher, and have recommended it to several others. I am looking forward to the sequel.
__label__2 A good, strong cordless vacuum: This is second Eureka 96B I have purchased. Other than the vendor (True Value) shipping a purple color when the photo and prior one was black, it is an excellent cordless vacuum. Lots of power and easy to use, also does not scratch wood floors.
__label__1 Beware of hair: I bought this product 2 years ago and it is overall, good at picking up all dust and crumbs, especially on carpets. However, as it picks up any hair, they immediately get rolled up in the roller. There is no easy way to get tangled hair off of the roller. I have to sit there and cut and pull off the dirty hair in order to keep the vacuum working well and the roller not full of hair. For people with short hair, I see how this wouldn't be a problem, but any woman knows that when you brush your hair you lose strands and they get caught in corners.
__label__2 Great quick vaccum for hard surfaces: We use this on our vinyl flooring and a short pile rug. Picks up a lot of dirt and dust, does well with pet and people hair, and today it picked up a chilli powder mess quickly. Not very loud either. Only problem I have is reinserting the filter after emptying because it's a little tricky to get it in just right without the rubber outer edge sticking out too much. Actually fun to use!!
__label__1 It didn`t impress me.: I was disappointed wit this vac. Not as much suction as I would have like. And you have to hang the thing up to recharge it. The extra battery was a nice touch. For the money it might not be bad, but I wish I had spent a little more for a better vac.
__label__2 Good for Quick Pick-Ups: I have been very pleased with this little vac. I run it through the kitchen and bathrooms almost daily for hair pick-up and it works great on the hard surface floors and small throw rugs. I only gave this 4 stars due to two small design "flaws" (perhaps they are user issues). The first being the button that clicks the base back into the stick, it is a little small and it doesn't feel like it really locks the unit in. For some reason I also have a tough time fitting the filter back into the unit properly after emptying it, but neither of those issues are a big deal to me. It is a good product for the price and it arrived in one business day!
__label__2 I could not be more pleased!: I live in a New York City studio and this product could not be any better for me. It is compact and easy to store out of view, it has very good suction both on carpet and wood floor areas, and it is not too noisy. I love it!
__label__2 Handy and quick: I was looking for an easy-to-use vac mostly for quick pet hair pick up. This one fills the bill just fine, and it's lightweight. My only complaint would be cleaning the filter and brushes after each use. But, you can't beat it for the price.
__label__2 the Eureka Quick-up is very time & work saving.: This one I bought for my daughter as I have one myself and like it very much. She got two different vacuums for Christmas,so I don't know which one she'll keep. The disadvantage of the Eureka is that you have to clean the filter often. I dump out the crumbs, etc, but the cat hair I have to use a tooth brush to clean the filter. I'd prefer not to have to touch the dust, etc. Otherwise It's a great little vacuum, I use it often on the kitchen floor-- and small areas on the carpeting when necessary.
__label__2 Eureka 96B a Good Buy: I am overrall pleased with the purchase. The unit is not too noisy, the suction is good and I like the rotary brush that can be activated for carpeting. After each vacuuming, I'm surprised at how much it picks up....we have 3 cats. My only suggestion for new buyers is for them to purchase a second battery...the original one lasts about 20 minutes or so and I don't charge it until it's fully drained due to the memory retention effect of Nickel Cadmium batteries.
__label__1 Buy this if you want to poison your dog: This book stinks. I bought it a few months ago and immediately returned it. Amazon is awesome.This is just random recipes with no dog nutrition in mind. I bought it thinking it would show me creative and fun ways to safely make my dogs something they would really enjoy. Instead I got a book filled with random recipes of common household foods with no nutritional value for a dog in mind. Some of the recipes even included raisins. There were other things in the book that you should not feed your dog, but I don't recall what those were anymore. I just remember being highly upset that this book was actually being sold.Don't buy this.
__label__2 MF Horn Series: This album was my introduction to Maynard. As a high school trumpet player this LP simply blew my mind. I have given up trumpet playing but not my love for Maynard and his music. His albums dominate my record collection. Bravo to Wounded Bird for putting this on CD. I am waiting for rest of the MF horn series to come out on CD. This album rocks as does the whole MF series.If you like screaming trumpet this album is the one.
__label__2 M F Horn Vol 1 - Big Band Jazz: Terrific big band jazz - MF is a master of the horns - band is great and enthusiastic - classic sounds and songs - an outstanding five star jazz collectible...
__label__2 Major R.K.Cross brought the book to life: I hope you all enjoyed Major R.K. Cross- he is my english professor! Mr. Howard Bahr is a very commendable man, he also has a very nice laid-back-on-the river-in-the-summer-sipping Jack-Daniels-and-lemonade drawl. He is quite inspiring.
__label__2 Excellent Historical Fiction: This is one of the few books which I have felt compelled to read more than once. The story is entertaining from front to back cover with Mr. Bahr managing to pull the reader along with a writing style that is unique and engaging. I found the characters believable and the action intense. Mr. Bahr delivers a strong story without giving in to predictable sentimentalities that plague so many novels of this type.I recommend this book to anyone interested in a good story, not only those with an interest in American Civil War history.
__label__1 Don't buy it! Unless you like really loud rattling noises...: Stay far away from this product. The pump is very poorly isolated from the hood assembly. If you don't get it seated JUST EXACTLY right, it vibrates like crazy, causing a HORRIBLE noise. Very loud. What's worse, it seems that even if you do get it seated right, over time it shifts causing the vibration noise again. I am extremely unhappy with this. Sure, it looks nice and is convenient, but unless you have total hearing loss or live in an assembly plant, the noise makes it a worthless purchase. I'd give it zero stars if I could.
__label__1 Owners manual in large print.: The book is two books in one: a rehash of the owners manual, but with some errors (like referring the reader to the non-existant metering mode button); and a tutorial on basic photography.If you already know what depth-of-field is and how to compose a shot, and if you still have your owners manual from the D50, save your money and skip this book.
__label__2 GE 35810: Although I haven't much experience with 2-way radios, I have found it to be a most satisfactory device. It is very easy to use, and has excellent range. It is also very clear. The only things which might be considered faults are that it is not entirely water-resistent, and tends to act strangely in the cold weather. I found the multitude of functions quite impressive, such as the battery-level indicator and the temperature. The pager is also very handy, as is the ability to lock one's settings. I would definitely recommend this product.
__label__2 Great compilation from Dino!: Have no idea what the displayed album art shown above is, but it's NOT this CD. This CD contains 22 songs from Dino, and each one's a gem. A lot of his hits, and some that should have been hits. The collection includes: 1. That's Amore, 2. Once in a While, 3. When you're smiling, 4. Innamorata, 5. True Love, 6. Non Dimenticar, 7. Volare, 8. You Belong to Me, 9. Just Say I Love Her, 10. Dream a Little Dream of Me, 11. Just in Time, 12. I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face, 13. Return to Me, 14. Someday, 15. Come Back to Sorrento, 16. You're Nobody 'til Somebody Loves You, 17. Dream, 18. Standing on the Corner, 19. You're Breaking My Heart, 20. Memories are Made of This, 21. I Don't Know Why, 22. I'll Alway Love You.
__label__2 A pure jewel: Truffaz pushes further the exploration of Jazz with "magrehbin" sonorities and electronic influences... it is a total success.An audacious project that i class in the first rank of my 2005 Montreal Jazz festival discoveries.
__label__1 I like Invader Zim, but...: The latest in a long line of attempts to cash in on the Invader Zim license, it seem like these DVD sets omit many of the great special features included in the initial DVD's that garnered the fan base they have now. Invader Zim is a quirky, dark cartoon that never got a fair shake from Nickelodeon because of shows like Rugrats clogging up the airwaves. Anyone who's wandered into a Hot Topic in the past few years knows what a cash-cow Viacom missed out on by cutting this series short. That being said, these DVD's don't do the show justice. Do yourself a favor, and track down the initial three volume DVD release (used) to enjoy all the extras, commentaries, and animatics for episodes that were never completed.
__label__1 come on, invader zim?: well the girls at my school like this show but i personally don't like it, because they are starting to act like that gir character, and i mean come on, a dog that is a robot? i would not recommend this to children.
__label__1 They are NOT serious!: This was the most demented and disturbing cartoon ever made since Aaah Real Monsters. I mean, seeing a giant ailen zit pop? What is that? I have no idea why people even like this show.
__label__1 One word: What kind of show is this? This show is the STUPIDEST thing ever. Nicktoons used to have good shows like Hey Arnold. Parents do not let your kids watch this show or they will think every thing is related to aliens and outer space.
__label__2 I love this album.: My initial thought was that a band with such long of a name couldn't be any good. I was completely wrong. I accidentally saw them live and bought the album the next day.There are a few other reviewers here that do this album more justice than I can. What I can say is that I love it. Interesting compositions. Fun lyrics. Realistic lyrics. Unique and extremely listenable. I love this album!
__label__1 Poor print quality: Don't buy this book. I just received mine and the type print is terrible. The book is a photocopy ofthe original and the print is very light, illegible on some pages, and generally hard to read. Find anedition from a different publisher.
__label__1 Horrible: This CD is horrible. The cheap unbalanced music arrangement and the ear-scratching voices are just insane. I realize this CD is for babies, but man, they have ears too. Why torture them?
__label__2 replacement filters have not been utilized as yet: I purchased these replacement filters to help reduce the possibility of mineral white dust forming from our hard water. Since we just recently purchased the humidifier and it came equipped with an initial filter included, we have not had to use this replacement set. The recommendation is that these filters should be replaced every 6 months.
__label__2 SPT ION F-4010 Replacement Filter: Okay, it's a replacement filter. I guess it works just fine. I will continue to purchase these because I will continue to have a need. No negatives about the product to speak of.
__label__2 Awesome Superscope PAC770: We own 12 of these awesome units at 6 locations and use them several hours each day by several different fitness instructors. Superscope has also provided us with excellent service on a couple units where staff abused the CD tray on one and buttons on another. We are looking to buy 3 more units each year for the next 4 years as we plan to add more studios. I hope the new units are in stock soon.
__label__1 Nothing Special: If you want to see Hudson Leick topless, Something About Sex has a better scene for that & it's a decent overall movie though she only has a bit part in it. She has a larger role in this movie but it still doesn't save the movie from mediocrity. Combined with elements of rape & drug use, I just found it hard to enjoy.
__label__1 Grant Seeking in an Electronic Age: I recommend not purchasing this book. The book (purchased new for over $70 then express shipped for a grant writing course in graduate school) is literally falling apart. The quality is poor. (the publishers should be ashamed). I agree with another reviewer that the charts are poor. I feel sorry for the authors that this book is of such poor quality from the publisher because I liked the smaller chapters which were written in a clear, concise writing style. However,this book is not for an advanced researcher or writer . . . more tailored to freshmen level.
__label__1 Slow delivery & restocking fee: The ornament is cute & looks just like the picture. The description says 2- 3" Ceramic Pig Ornament and shows 2 ornaments in the picture, but I only received one so I felt the item description was very misleading. I placed the order 2 weeks before a Christmas gift exchange and did not receive the shipment in time for the exchange so I had to return it. The company charges a 15% restocking fee for returns from orders placed through Amazon so you may want to consider this when ordering.
__label__1 Not really worth it...: First off, I am not a big PMM fan. I heard their song on the End of Days Sound Track and thought it was pretty good. That song is on this CD, but as a ... with shittier production. This might be a CD a NIN fan might like, but I (as a devout follower of Godsmack and Static-X)thought it sucked.
__label__1 Garbage Can Material: You have to be in the tiny range of Protestants and Vatican II Catholics, who love the present Vatican movement to merge Catholics and Lutherans as one religion, to buy any basic premise in this book. It will not teach you one valid thing that you can use to "christianize" anyone, and it can only serve as an emotional warm fuzzy if you fit the stated reader profile. You will not come away with any useful "argument," but you could in a self delusion find yourself with your "arguments" pitted against others, such as well educated fundamental Christians and Traditional Catholics who have daggers five inches long.Buyer Beware. I threw my copy in the trash can.
__label__2 Handbook of Christian Apologetics: This book was very informative. If you are looking for answers to defend your Christian faith, this is the book to have. It is also a good study tool.
__label__1 Don't expect too much if you are non-believer: When I bought this book I was non-believer of Christianity who expect dramatic break through about Christianity from this book and I got badly disappointed. While the author did great job on some field but overall the book contains fundamental problems of Christian apologetics such as mentioning the bible to back up his logistics. For non-believer, it wouldn't work if you choose bible as primary reference for your explanation, since non-believer do not believe the bible itself. It is like explaining gravity to someone who doesn't understand the Newton's law itself. "Because Newton says so" wouldn't work. To make it work the author should see things as non-believer but it is as much hard as the non-believer tries to understand the believer. It is a good book but I have a doubt if it is useful book.
__label__1 merlin mustek bearpaw scanner 1200: I hate it! I was ripped off when I bought this. How could I know that I would never be able to ugrade it to a new Operating System. You could at least write new drivers for Windows XP and Windows 2000.I feel cheated!Rose Mary Hughes
__label__2 Not a classical music affecionato: I'm not a particular fan of classical music because it puts me to sleep. However, this selection, which pulls out familiar parts is good listening and enjoyable because one can recognize the music from movies, excerpts, etc. Very enjoyable for someone who can't sit through a symphony.
__label__1 Really?: How can anyone be expected to get into this book? I've heard how great it was from friends but its just so unbelieveable that its hard to get into the story. I mean, Harry Potter was more realistic and believable then this. I hated Harry Potter. Shame people are in love with such poor fiction writing.
__label__1 Truth: I have never heard of this Jesus person till just recently. I could not believe no one told me about him before. This book had so many great stories in it. Then I found out people actually thought they were TRUE?? Are ya brain dead?
__label__1 Book of Lies: The problem with this book is not that its lame and boring, which it is. The problem is that people think its nonfiction.
__label__2 what king James is this of?: Which King James - one of England, France, Scotland?Anyway, this is a very nice little Bible to have. It is a beautiful and traditional Bible with a leather cover and gold words which say 'Holy Bible' on the front. pUT god into your life,peace
__label__1 Good but not quite great: I feel that this book started out well but lacked something of an ending. The writing styles change intermittedly and seem to lack something of a finesse, blatantly stating things that cannot be taken literally or figuratively well enough to purvey a superior understanding of the text. I found it about as entertaining as flipping through a T.V. guide but not owning a T.V. seeing all the shows that you could be watching explained in a summerized detail that never quite lets you know what it's really all about. A true literary flop.
__label__1 Stuffy and Overrated: Put it right on the shelf with the rest of the fiction.Sex, Violence, persecution, discrimination, racism, incest, murders aplenty... this book has it all. On top of that it's hard to read because of the archaic use of language.Written 50 years after the alleged death of Jesus. Translated by just about anyone who wanted to. REWRITTEN by every ruler who didn't like what the older version said.Why does the bible have more sex than a daytime Soap? Because sex sells.
__label__1 Meh: Starts off with a bang but kinda drags towards the middle. The author needs to do some work on pacing and climactic elements. Could've used a vampire, too.
__label__2 Perfect all purpose Bible: This is a great Bible for someone looking to get a Bible that isn't watered down through translation. Nice unassuming hard cover.Sharp printing. Contains 64,000 more words that the NIV has removed including words like mercyseat, Jehovah, and Godhead. It contains meaningful, well-known Bible words like Calvary, Lucifer, new testament, regeneration that the NIV leaves out completely.Don't be deceived by all those here that don't want people to have a true copy of the Bible. There's a reason so many have gone out of their way to write a 1-star review for this product.
__label__2 My most valued CD: I bought the series of LAST GOOD PLACE on Earth when I visited the United States in 1993 from the Nature company. I brought them back to Malaysia and listen to them to remember the good places that I visited for years. When my family moved to the United States in 2000, Glacier Bay, Bayou, the Caribbean and Cloud Forest are the very few precious CDs that I have taken with me.

__label__2 Best printer I've ever owned!: I was at Staples looking at the new Canon printers to replace my old BJC-620, when the M750 caught my eye. I asked for a demo and bought the machine. Tried to set it up using USB connection: No-go. But the problem was in my HP8490 computer. Parallel setup was extremely easy. I have had a couple of false error signals, but nothing I can't live with. Fewer than with any of the Canon or HP printers I've had. The BW print is crisp and clear, was used to print registries for a worldwide military association. In fact, my boss and I were so impressed with this printer that we purchased one to use to print invoices at our office. The black and white quality of this printer is better than the $500.00 HP1220 Professional Ink Jet printer we own. I haven't compared the color quality yet. We are planning to purchase at least two more for the office. I would recommend this to anyone or any business that prints 100-250 pages per day.
__label__2 Good impression after two weeks: I have had this printer for about two weeks now and so far it is an excellent value. Out of the box it was easy to set up, and the drivers were a snap. One caution for W2K users though, drivers for W2K need to be downloaded from the internet. I am not sure why Xerox does it that way, but the drivers do install quite easily.Print quality is great, and you have four levels of detail. I print a monthly tenant newsletter, and I use draft quality to save ink. It printed out 70 copies in about 5 minutes in draft mode!Overall I am impressed with the quality. I will complain that the receiver tray can pop off sometimes during printing. A strange effect indeed. With all the advantages though (I run mine via USB) and an awesome price, I HIGHLY recommend this printer. You will not be dissappointed.
__label__1 Piece of Crap: I have wasted hours trying to get this printer to work properly.Even when it was brand new, and sort of worked, the print quality was terrible with fuzzy characters and colors that were way off. And yes, I was using the right kind of paper.I have gotten about thirty barely usable pages out of this printer. After that it began to malfunction.Xerox did its customers and itself a big disservice by ever selling this piece of junk.
__label__2 Good quality for price...: I was so impressed by the low price and comparable print quality of the M750 that I decided to try it instead. To date, I haven't had any problems with the machine and am quite pleased with its performance. It is a great piece of equipment for a home-based business or family-owned PC.
__label__1 Incorrect samples - incorrect album?: Can't believe after all this time since amazon were first alerted that the samples are still playing the wrong album. Is the download the correct album does anyone know?
__label__1 no fun: I really can't say anything good about this game. The controls are way too slow, and the models are painfully simple. I only got through 2 levels before deciding that this game was not worth my time.
__label__2 book: My husband really enjoyed reading this biography. He could hardly put the book down. Well written and very interesting!
__label__2 Complex individual.: Chernow is one of the few biographers who can take an enormous amount of information on a subject and create a book that is even-handed and interesting. Since this is a figure that is both reviled and lionized, I think the author's purpose was to present all sides to this complex person and let the reader come to his own conclusions. Chernow's research of Rockefeller's childhood reveals a lot about the way he turned out as an adult, and the author's writing style points out both his strengths and shortcomings as well as showing how Standard Oil's rise to the top came about and the ruthless actions Rockefeller took to get it there. In the latter part of the book, as Rockefeller retires and ages, the book concentrates mostly on John Jr. as well as his daughters and heirs. While this was necessary for a complete story, I felt some of this could have been edited better. This is still a first-rate, detailed biography.
__label__2 Titan by Ron Chernow: Simply put, this book is a sheer Masterpiece. It is well researched and is absolutely brilliantly written. After reading it, I started reading it all over again. I am an avid reader of non-fiction and this is one the best I have read. ENCORE !
__label__2 A+ for "Titan": This is an excellent biography. It is the only one that I have read on Rockefeller. If anyone is interested in him and or Standard Oil, read this book first. It is extremely well written and Chernow did a great job in holding my attention. This book it 10 times better than the late Joseph Wall's biography of Andrew Carnegie. "Titan" is not slanted or biased either way regarding Rockeffer. Don't be daunted by the book's size. It is a great book!
__label__1 Ejay is better: This program is ok, but it doesn't have enough samples as much as eJay. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND that you take one of the EJAY CDs(techno, rave, dance, hip-hop, etc) or take EJAY SE.ThanksDanny Dyer
__label__2 Everything about it strokes the senses: "Don't pick up this book unless you plan to stay up all night: Susan Leslie Liepitz draw you in deep with characters so real they might come knocking at your door. . . . [Captain Blake Masters] is a true hero-very human in spite of being handsome; compassionate yet practical; and realistically frustrating at times. . . . Ms. Liepitz chooses words exquisitely in her sensual prose. The transitions in time are plausible and the author's take on how people perceive life after death touches the heart. This is a mystical story, woven well. Everything about it strokes the senses, giving the imagination a curl-your-toes workout." 4 stars Cyndie Dennis-Greer reviewing for Romantic Times
__label__1 Micro fiber panties: Not at all what I thought I was getting. If I thought these were going to be thinner than a slip, feels thinner than pantyhose and overall uncomfortable and see through, I wouldn't have bought them. In white pants, you can't wear them. They weren't comfortable for me. Maybe for others.
__label__1 Ye olde programmed software crash: I had long loved my TI-85, but it finally met it's doom after going thru three highschool careers between me and the kids. I bought the CAS as a replacement and felt comfortable immediately with the calculator. After a few months the software mysteriously erased itself (no OS installed), so I worked on reinstalling. The only issue is that you must purchase additional software from TI and they could not care less about your device that crashed and that you already paid for it.It's sad a calculator company can't continue their use of stable software and after it fails won't back it up.
__label__1 Disappointing compared to Hall's other work...: This book gives us a brief picture of life in the South Pacific during WWII. But, it's not so much about the war as it is about the inevitability of change. The author tries to present the so-called tragedies of industrialization injected into an idyllic environment of stagnant (though supposedly blissful) island culture. Although I did enjoy this book, especially the can-do attitude of the American Army and Navy engineers, the obvious dichotomy between the American sense of life and the anti-technology philosophy that plagues the main character is disappointing.
__label__2 drigerf: hey when i gotthis toy i swear i thoughtit was the worst blade everbut if you buy more beybladesand switch the blades weight destit will be strong
__label__1 Do not bother: This blade [is bad]! Trust me, if you want a powerful beyblade stick with Drigger V-1. Believe me when I used it I broke two of my launchers! I am the leader of my own Blade Sharks team and the bottom line do not get this blade! I suggest Drigger V-1!
__label__2 GREAT: This Bey rocks! Although it doesnt have a good endurance, its attack is awesome. but i warn you, THIS BLADE IS NOT FOR AMETUERS!you need to know jus how to spin it so itdoesnt go in a pocket......IM me at Skaterman927 on aim. LET IT RIP!
__label__2 Works with factory steering controls seamlessly: I ordered this to work with my factory Subaru steering wheel controls and Pioneer AVIC-X910BT head unit, and it works perfect, I've had no issues with it after 6 months of use. The only thing was I had to get the latest programming instructions off the company's website. Instructions were included, but did not cover my vehicle, no big deal though. Programming was simple after reading the instructions twice.
__label__2 Delivers its promise: This book keeps its promise of delivering "101 essential tips". From choosing cutting tools to repairing a button hole, there are lots of tips to satisfy the beginner sewer. While I like the layout, which includes step-by-step instructions accompanied by photos, this little book could be vastly improved by adding a few more pictures to some of the tips to make them more clear. A couple of pictures could also be improved by better choice of colour (e.g. attaching a flat collar, which is a glaring yellow, and darning a hole, which is so well done you cannot see the example stitches clearly enough!). Nevertheless, overall it is a very useful book.
__label__2 So far so good!: This is the OEM SP installed in my 01 Sentra SE and at 140k miles it is time to replace them. After seeing the gaps on the original plugs I am thinking I should have replaced them at the 80k mile mark. In terms of longevity I highly recommend it.
__label__2 Is it nu metal?: I dont remember how I first heard of this cd, but im glad I did. Its a great cd and well worth a listen. I dont know if i'd call it nu metal, do they have a dj in the band? The follow up cd wasnt as heavy as this cd and disappointed me.
__label__1 Research?: Wow! The lack of research is clear within this edition. As a student of this period of English history for over 7 years, I must recommend that anyone researching this young lady to consider earlier publications.
__label__1 Bland: This is your run-of-the-mill southern album. One thing it was fortunately missing was a slew of guest appearances and skits galore. There are a few tracks that stand out amongst the rest but even these are tracks that you could live without hearing. It sounded like K-Rab (supposed father of Snap Music) and this group wanted to cash in on what's hot at the moment. And that's subpar beats made by a Casio. If you're interested in buying this, don't have high expectations.Tracks Worth Mentioning:Do The Poole PalaceHit Me On My MetroSteady Choppin'
__label__2 solid guitar stand: We are currently using this stand for a guitar and banjo. It looks nice and it isn't too bulky which is definitely a plus. Best of all, it's very sturdy.
__label__2 Great Soundtrack: This is such a great soundtrack. If you love this movie like my family does, having this soundtrack is a must!
__label__1 solder gun: needs more power. May be fine to burn wood but bad to solder wire connections. Not fine enough for board soldering or big enough for larger wire.
__label__2 I love this cd!: I have been listening to this cd for a few months now. I fell in love with it the first time I heard it. It's both soothing and uplifting at the same time, a real plus for me. I highly recommend it as a sensory treat and a true pleasure to listen to.
__label__1 Boring: I am a science teacher and hoped to use this to teach when watching the new Hobbit movieThe book was not real helpfulMostly just opinions and and the author talking to themsevles
__label__2 fast delivery: They arrived fast. I hope to never need them, but just in case ... I bought 6 packs for the whole family and put them in our BOBs. They expire in 2017 and are individually sealed, so I feel we'll have some "insurance" until then.
__label__2 vital piece of health insurance: Read about the spent fuel pool at Fukushima #4, researched the product and this is the best of the bunch. Think of it as a dollar per year per person insurance against radiation poisoning (given the 8 year shelf life) in the event of an emergency, be it the fuel pools at Fukushima or elsewhere. I cannot imagine living anywhere on the West Coast, or west of the Mississippi for that matter, and not having this item on-hand. If there is a(nother) nuclear emergency, Potassium Iodide from any source will be unavailable within hours.
__label__2 Hope it works!: Hasn't been a chance to use it but I know this stuff will work. Came in fast and this stuff is legit.
__label__1 Great Concept, Poor Quality: I like the design, the colors but the the quality is bad. Within a few hours of use the stitching started coming apart. Would not recommend, belkin makes a similar product (without the button) and it is 10x as durable... The quality on this product is not worth the cost...
__label__2 Simply the best iron I ever owned or used: I LOVE this iron I have been using mine since about March 2006.Have never had any problems with it, but I fear that it willgo out and I can not replace it since it is not being made anymore.Love the feature to disable the auto-off, and the wide range of heatsettings, and the long cord.The constant beeping is annoying, but after 6 yrs I have grown useto it.Simply the BEST iron I ever used or owned.
__label__2 A fun way to learn punctuation!: Mr. Period introduces young writers to his friends. There is Mr. Open Quotation Mark, Mr. Closed Quotation Mark, Mr. Comma, Mr. Exclamation Point, and Ms. Question Mark, among others.Each of the friends has a place and Mr. Period explains their function in a fun way. There are stickers of the punctuation marks at the end of the book that will fit in the blanks of the story on the last page. The illustrations bring all the Pals to life.Armchair Interviews says: What a fun way to learn punctuation. There are more than a few adults who need to read this!
__label__2 Great Kit - Just needs more products: This kit was great! The cookbook was very helpful and had great sushi ideas. The items were high quality, I just wish there were more of them. I would recommend it for all who love sushi.
__label__2 Great sushi starter kit: I was looking for the perfect gift to give my sister and I stumbled on this. My sister loves sushi so much and I like the fact that she'll be able to make her own sushi. She hasn't tried making her own sushi and I was there when she first used the kit - it was fairly easy to use! The instructions and all the materials needed to make your own sushi are complete. It even has a cookbook and that and a bamboo mat for rolling up your creations. I ended up buying another set for myself so now I already have sushi in my menu. It's a perfect hobby for a housewife and I'm thinking of starting a small business soon. Of course I will need more complex tools to make more sushi but the sushi making kit is a perfect way to start it off. It's a complete beginner guide and it didn't cost me a hundred dollars!
__label__2 Awesome for any sushi lover or lovers: I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my in-laws, it is absolutly wonderful! All that is needed is the fish and or vegetables! I recommend this all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Hard to use: This product is much harder to use than described. The receipes are easy to follow, but the rolling is very difficult, and the insructions were vague, I found myself having to turn to the internet to look up instructions and rolling techniques. The ingredients were all very high quality, but all were available in my local supermarket. Would not recommend.
__label__2 Fun Gift: If you have someone that is hard to buy for, this may be your answer. Kit has everything you need besides the fillings. Makes for a fun sushi making night, does take several hours though.
__label__2 Sushi Chef: Excellent product, detailed instructions on how to prepare the rice. Has a few recipes for rolls, would have liked a few more, but that's what the internet is for. Was very nice having everything right out of the box. I would suggest using a zip-lock bag or plastic wrap for the rolling mat if you wish to preserve it for future use. The sushi I made turned out pretty amazing, all on my first try.I would suggest this product to anyone who is interested in this hobby.
__label__2 Great Anniversary Gift!: I purchased this as part of an anniversary gift for my husband. We haven't used it yet, but he was very excited to receive it and can't wait to use it! It was also delivered very quickly!
__label__1 Very bad: Item arrived all moldy inside, it had to be broken for some time before. Nobody noticed the mold before packing for shippment.
__label__2 not bad: The kit contains everything you need besides the fish so it is a really great kit. Makes an awesome gift but I reccomend going to a store and purchasing. When it arrived in the mail, the lid on the wasabi container was shattered and the rice bag was torn open and rice was everywhere... luckily it was all contained in a plastic wrapped packaging so the rice was contained in the orginal packaging but it was a gift for my boyfriend so I was disappointed when it arrived and we opened it. We just put the wasabi in one of our own tupperweare container and the loose rice in a ziplock bag.
__label__1 Far From Like New: Cd case was cracked in all directions and cd itself had a white cloudy substance all over it. Not very happy with this purchase.
__label__1 Slow, confusing, frustrating: After hearing and reading so many positive reviews of ME, I thought I'd give it a try. ME has a lot going for it -- a rich story, great graphics, and hours of gameplay. The only trouble is that the game is incredibly tedious. I spent at least two hours at the beginning just running around a space station jib-jabbing with people, and getting completely lost in the process. They tell you to go here, then there, then back again...ugh.Then when something entertaining does actually take place, they don't give you enough checkpoints. One mission I was nearly 30 minutes into, then *bam* -- I died from a fluke and had to start all over again.I really wanted to like ME, but it's a drag.
__label__1 A lot of hype: I bought this game to try and get caught up with the series for the release of Mass Effect 3. The graphics are impressive and the story and background behind it is interesting. My problems stem from the stagnant dialogue and, frankly, boring gameplay. I always feel like I'm missing something though, as if there's another layer to the game I haven't caught onto yet. I'm still trudging through, trying to find this missing component.
__label__2 Fun game, despite the wait.: My only complain was the waiting on the elevators. The NXE Game install kinda got rid of that but it was too late for me I was nearly done with the game already.Its a great game though, pick it up if you can.
__label__2 5/5 - Immersive RPG: Combat:The battles and combat are exciting, and because landscapes change and your armour and weapons can be upgraded, combat does not get boring or repetitive. Leveling up frequently keeps you interested in developing your character for combat.Dialogue:The dialogue is well written. Characters are believable and interesting.Storyline:This is what makes the game five-star worthy. It pulled me in from the very beginning and never let go. When I finished the game, I just started it right back up and through again. And again. And every time I did that, I enjoyed it more. Until ME2 came out, and then ME3 (which I have not finished).If you need fast-paced shooter action, this isn't the game for you. If you prefer plot and character development, you might fall in love with this game's cast and story. I did.
__label__1 Awful Follow-Up to KOTOR: Let me say Knights of the Old Republic is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. The way they meshed turn-based combat with real time was a revelation that no game has since matched. But this game was boring as hell. I played it for over 5 hours, and all it seemed to me was a running simulator with a bad third person shooter mechanic thrown in. Sure, the conversation mechanic was interesting for the first 10 minutes or so, but after a while it was like watching a movie I had to also direct, instead of just enjoying it. Generic sci-fi themes also abounded, lacking the cohesiveness of the Star Wars universe for an underlying premise. I would say Bioware is great at interpreting a story that has already been realized for them, but awful at trying to come up with an original concept, AND executing it in an interesting fashion.
__label__1 Boring,Boring,and Boring: i have wasted 3 days of my life playing this pointless boring game i do not know what everyone sees in this game i kept playing just thinking it would get better but no it doesnt the graphics are great but the gameplay sucks you just have to stand there during endless talking scenes and when it is over guess what here comes another talking scene you feel like you are playing a movie rather than a video game please rent this game before you buy it i am so glad that i did .thanks for reading
__label__1 CD doesn't work: It ran up to the point that said clean the CD with a soft cloth and I cleaned it several times still I can't play.That is all I can say about this game.
__label__1 Great Story, Horrible Combat: Probably the absolute WORST combat manuevers ever. Player is slow to move; squad members do not listen to commands; game is riddled with bugs. One of the most annoying characteristics is that you cannot fast-forward through much of the talking sequences.
__label__2 A Great Sci-Fi Adventure!: One of my personal favorites of all time. Definitely jump into the Mass Effect universe and play the whole trilogy of games!
__label__2 Best Game Ever-Saved My Mind: I work a lot and never really had time for anything, I went to sleep and would dream of work then I would wake up and work some more.Mass Effect is one of the best games ive ever played being a fan of Fable, Gears of War series, the Halo series ect.And its super cheap so its a must buy and i chipped in the extra cash to over night it,
__label__2 No Team Boo. . .: this is acctually probably more like a 3.5 stars, but I like MOS. I fell it falls between my solo project and our constant concern as far as quality goes. Team boo was unbelieveable and was the stand out best album from them. While this shows the same creativity and harmonious song writing, it lacks the charming upbeat major tonality found on some of their others
__label__2 LIBERATION FROM SELF: Erudite, fascinating look at difficult topic. Berofsky captures all the complex elements of this tough philosophical treatise. Excellent scholarship, its easy-going style helps even the lay person to understand even its most difficult ideas.
__label__2 scholarly readin: very broken down for anyone who needs to write a paper at any level.I use it with my students at the middle school level
__label__2 Bookmarks: A Guide to Research and Writing: This book was listed as used, but arrived looking brand new in a very timely manner. I have been using it for my class and will be keeping it since it is a great reference for citation for the different styles of writing.
__label__2 Excellant Seller: The book arrived in excellant condition. Shipment fast. A pleasure to do business with sellers like this one. In fact we bought a second one. Thank You
__label__2 far from exhaustive but well done!: The one point i took off is for lacking gradual switch to Ukrainian as the reader gains knowledge of the language.It'd've been great practice and more of an immersion in the Ukrainian language.This is indeed a very simple book, but it sure can allow itself to be one, since it's the ONLY BOOK on the market (more or less).Ukrainian is the first slavic language and though had long existed in the doldrums of occupation, the trend in Ukraine is strengthening it as a national language and it seems like it's heading to be the 6th most widely spoken native tongue in Europe after Russian, German, English, French and Italian.*note that it is practically useless for those with prior knowledge of other slavic languages. It is oriented at English-speakers.
__label__1 BOO!!: We live in Germany as part of the military and I was trying to find something that my 7 year old daughter could use to help learn the language. This was just awful! Don't waste your time or money. You can youtube the stuff that was on this video and have better luck. They don't really give you a lot of time to try and say the word before jumping on to the next word or phrase. Also, you only hear the word once and you are expected to get it from that one time. It was painful to watch and we just turned it off. Not worth your money. Trust me! Keep looking and find something else.
__label__1 Not Worth the Money: 1. The CD is not by the Department of Defense so that endorsement should be removed.2. The CD contains information easily found on the web.3. Don't waste your money. The CD isn't worth it.
__label__1 Focus on DHTML too MUCH !: This book talks lots of basic content about internet ! If you want to write internet applications , you should learn the use of DHTML and ASP, which I think is the most important. However, this book focuses on the use of DHTML within Visual Basic 6. I think it's better to reference other books containing the use of WebClass within VB6 after you read this book.
__label__2 The long awaited album is finally here!: Jason LeVasseur and Jerry Chapman provide a refreshing change to todays musical scene. They write there own songs and play their own instruments, take that Backstreet Boys! The new album blends together seamlessly the contrasting musical styles of LaVasseur and Chapman. Though only two, the sound is that of a full band. Having toured together for years, the new album is tight and feels as if they are singing live for you. The songwriting is intimate and heartfelt. "Big Sky" is magical, "Hopscotch in Oz" highlights Chapman's strong voice, "Spacegirl" is hard to get out of your head, and the rest of the album does not disappoint. Don't just buy the CD, make sure that you catch them live the next time they are in your town. They are a fun act live, and this album catches that energy.
__label__1 Bland Bat: This book was disappointing. Bland, flacid, superficial ... pointless, except for the Bat-neophyte. You'd have to know next to nothing about Batman to appreciate this book. It breaks no new ground, presents mediocre archive art in a boring way, and is a basic waste of money.
__label__2 Swing Out Sister does it again, Wonderful: After waiting patiently for the latest edition of Swing Out Sister to arrive, I could not wait to listen to the Stylish vocal's of Corrine. From the catchy "Who's been Sleeping, to the haunting vocal's on "Make you Stay, Swing Out Sister proves they are among the very best.This cd feed's your heart and soul. Thank you Swing Out Sister-La La La mean's I love you
__label__2 Lahaina: Eddie Kamai did a very nice job in presenting this DVD about the history of Lahaina.....Love this town, now I know more history....A must buy for Maui lovers!
__label__1 Yuck!: Yes, that's my opinion of "The White Room". Okay, how many times is this woman Polly going to faint? That got really old. Her husband Tim is as interesting as a dish towel. I think my 6-year old could write a more interesting novel and come up with better dialog. I could go on about this book, but I think the other reviewers have covered it.
__label__2 Good product: I like the ease of installation of this ink cartridge and it's a lot cheaper than the HP printer ink I used to have to buy.
__label__1 Love the machine hate the cartridges: I agree with the other reviewer. I have the MP500 and this is a very nice all in one scan/print/copy no fax machine. However be prepared to shell out some bucks for the PGI-5. I am going thru about 1 every 3 weeks at a cost of about 15 bucks on very lite print jobs. I always use the fast print option. There is no compatible as of yet. I went thru Office Depot where I paid $15 per but got free shipping on orders of $50 or more. I might have to bring back my Epson for my black ink print jobs. The other four cartridges are wearing very well. This is the last printer I will ever buy that doesn't already have a compatible on the market. I am looking into refilling this cartridge with an ink kit however you have to disable the ink gauge on the printer.
__label__2 Works great: I replaced my electric start with this recoil starter. It fit my OS 18 motor. Great little pull starter. No more wasting time with batteries for the electric start.
__label__2 Interesting, applicable, and timeless...: The "Don't Sweat" series provides the reader with tools to organize and prioritize ones life. With the many different pressures placed upon us in our lives, Carlson hits home with this short read regarding the balance between our worklives and our homelife.Broken into extremely small chapters only one to three pages long, it is easy to take some time out and read a few chapters -- appealing to even the busiest of schedules.The only caveat is that one might be bored by the continual emphasis of the same points over and over again.
__label__2 The Dylan Paradox: On principle I have never given a live album 5 stars as you are assessing a performance rather than a creative piece of work. I very nearly broke my own rule for this CD. Not only did it preview a very fine album (Desire), it makes a mockery of the live 'Greatest Hits' trash he and others have mostly released.I saw a couple of the shows from his critically aclaimed tour of Oz with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in 1986. He was razor sharp but even those efforts pale when compared to his performances on this legacy from the Rolling Thunder Revue. Buy this CD if you have any interest in Dylan. It is simply a stunning example of just how good Dylan could be when enthused and making music with his mates.
__label__1 Wouldn't Install: This is the second Intel PC Camera that I've returned for not being compatible with my system.I'm running Windows Me Program and on trying to install the camera,I received error messages from the Intel Disk saying that it couldn't find certain files which were needed for installation.Upon deleting the camera from my system,the system froze up and I needed technical help from the computer company to fix the problem.No more PC cameras for me.Enjoyment should not include aggrevation.
__label__2 FANTASTIC: The sountrack to a thousand bonfires. The sheer beauty and depth of this album is astounding. BUY IY
__label__2 the art work: everything I expected, the price is great for a must have and classic vinyl. 1 1 1 1 1 1
__label__1 Maybe great back in the day...but today...: Egad. I bought this for my husband because he loved Oblivion so much. I was pretty sad with how dated it was. But I guess that's my fault since the game is around 8 years old. I'm sure it was great back in the day. Too bad we opened it. I wish we could return it...
__label__1 Not for everyone.: I love RPGs, both PC and console. I've played the big names, and whichever of the little ones I could find. So, of course, I tried Morrowind. To be honest, most people either love or hate this game. I can see where the love comes from - Morrowind is a party of aesthetic goodness. It boasts a gigantic world where freedom reigns. It also has a great community backing it up with fantastic unofficial add-ons. However, I can also see where the hate comes from. I do lean to that side after all. The combat and magic systems are terrible. The NPCs are lifeless and their dialogue equally drab. With freedom comes a feeling of aimlessness.Don't get too caught up in the "Game of the Year" title, or rave reviews - bad reviews neither. If you get the chance, try the game first. That's the only way you'll know where you stand. Keep an open mind, but don't think that you have to like it.
__label__2 One of the best: Morrowind is an absolutely wonderful game, with great music, great landscapes, an epic story, and pretty entertaining gameplay to boot. I can't call it perfect mainly because of the fact that like so many other Bethesda games, it's full of bugs. Many of these have been fixed by the community, and Morrowind has an absolutely mind-boggling array of mods available. The mods allow an almost infinite of in-game experience, and I heartily recommend this game to any fans of RPGs out there.
__label__2 Very helpful: Highly recommend. This book is worth it even just for the test-taking tips. It has helped my son immensely.
__label__1 Wrong Reason, Could have had better description.: This product is for Xbox 360 MEMORY UNITS not Hard Drives as apposed to the description. If used for the correct reason it appears it would work. I got a full refund,though. Also, this is an Unauthorized Product made by Datel, in case you wanted to know.
__label__1 XBox 360 Transfer Kit doesn't work: Doesn't work. Won't transfer files to your pc. There is a known problem with it, the info has been posted on the web, manufacturer has released a patch to fix it, and the patch only works for SOME people. We wasted our money on this one.
__label__2 Excellent Price: It took me a lot of reading and talking to others before I decided on this dual point distributor. While the Unilite distributor seems to be a quality product, I decided against it because if it fails on the road, you had better have a replacement in the trunk ready to go because you probably won't be finding a replacement without ordering it. The stock dual point distributors have worked fine for me for many years and I see this Mallory as being a huge improvement over stock. Because I am running multiple carbs and a long cam for the street, I do not have any vacuum anyway and this distributor has a large range of initial timing advance. I have not run it yet but will do so well before the manufacturers warranty expires. I shopped all over for price and found Amazon's price to be the lowest and the no tax and free shipping was just icing on the cake.
__label__2 Newmans Own: I am never disappointed with any products manufactured by Paul newman. These Chocolate-Chocolate creme are very good. Try The Hint of Mint as well.
__label__2 When chocolate Nutter Butters went away, I was sad. :(: But... then I found chocolate peanut butter Newman-O's and everything was right with the world again... in terms of cookie satisfaction, that is.I prefer to pull two of them apart, eating the two naked cookie halves - then smash the two halves w/peanut butter together to make a "double stuff" Newman-O. In my humble opinion there is no finer store-bought cookie enjoyment experience available on Earth at the current time.This is what you wave under my nose to make sure I'm REALLY dead.
__label__1 Leave this one at home when going to the beach: Bombay Time is a horrible book, reading it was a waste of time and a test of patience. The book deals with no real issues but does hit you in the face with the Indian Gosip train of family and neighbors. There are so many people meddling around with one anothers affairs that it becomes a frustrating read. Rather than providing an escape from the bickering and mundaneness of life this book whips you right into the thick of it.There are countless writers from the subcontinent that have done wonders in the world of literature sadly Ms. Umrigar isn't one of them.
__label__1 wrong item number on dscreption: on the page the item number is 010-10517-01 but when i got it ..it had another number which is 0110095502 ,,it came 7.4 not 8.4finally it does not fit my device
__label__2 ONE STAR?!?!? Is that guy INSANE?!?!?: I can not believe the sanity of any person who gives this album 1 star and WANTS to give it 0 stars. This is TMBG's best album by far, leaps and BOUNDS ahead of "Flood" which is weighed down by too many generic, mediocre songs and the simply terrible "Particle Man." Tell me, is 1 star applicable to any album that contains the following songs?: "The Statue Got Me High," "I Palindrome I," "The Guitar," "See The Constellation," "Space Suit," "Narrow Your Eyes," "Hall Of Heads," and of course the almighty "Fingertips"! That alone makes it worth the price of the album. I think that person should rethink his or her judgement of this album, because despite what people say ("Weaker than Flood, blah blah, [insert untrue stuff here]") this is truly TMBG at their peak. Both Johns contribute equally great songwriring here.
__label__2 very underrated MC: Grand Puba is One of the most slept on MC's ever. he had the skills to go from different styles and musical backgrounds with ease. this album is very east coast and has that whole vibe and built.back it up, baby what's your name and Check it out with Mary J. Bliege who Puba was on her debut album "what's the 411" are tight cuts.still a tight set.
__label__2 An Important Story: This book is well written, interesting and sad, but important, because I think this story is not well known, i.e., the situation of the Jewish families in that city in England. I also loved that the author included pictures of his family in the book.
__label__1 Not as advertised: Advertised as in very good condition...arrived stained with red liquid, wrinkled, hard to turn pages & coming apart. I read it, then trashed it.Only book I've ever trashed!! Hate to see your acceptable rating.
__label__1 The Invisible Wall: So far am and about 1/4 through the book - dull and boring - but I'll stick with it. Anne Magnolia
__label__2 Cute: I am a figure collector , I payed less than 20 bucks for this figure it came in time and very well packaged . The figure is well made and very cute paint quality is good and the figure stands about 7 inches if not a bit taller . Great product for a great price
__label__1 Bright, but will change the color of housing when off: I got these because I thought it would be nice to have brighter back up bulbs, but because they are blue they really darken the light housing and make it look well....blue. More than I anticipated they would. Then I tried them in the red brake light side and even there it darkened it to a ruby red that looked funny because of the blue color. They are nice and bright when working, but unless your looking for a blue lens housing look, stick with a clear/amber/chrome bulb. Also, pretty pricy for a small simple bulb.
__label__2 phish: mozart for the rock generation: I personaly dont think phish could ever go wrong and maybe its because they allow themselves that freedom. but this album in particular interests me because it takes me back to childhood and feeling good and about probably nothing at all. it couldnt ever hurt anyone to be happy for no reason! but as i heard it said once and i'll repeat it for all to hear... phish is like icecream for the ears!
__label__2 So its a silly one... get over it!!!: Yeah ok so this is not the best Phish studio realease but if you open your ears a little Lawn Boy is a fun little ditty to have around. Phish has proven to be quite versatile through the years and that makes them a choice rock act. Lawn Boy is full of that vesatility that only Phish can convey. A must have!!!Highlights include Split Open And Melt(a classic in live format), Bouncing Around The Room(also a live classic), the siily but fun My Sweet One, Run Like An Antelope, the peculiar and quirky Bathtub Gin and The Squirming Coil.Not a cd for first time Phishers but a cd not to be missed. ENJOY!!!!!
__label__1 Childish.: I found the characters to be both superficial and extremely unreliable. The dialogs are very disappointing, often shallow and unsophisticated. Unfortunately -so is the plot.
__label__2 BUY A SIZE BIGGER!: I just got mine today, and the fell well made, and comfortable. My only complaint is I didn't listen to the reviews and order one size up. I ordered mediums which fit, but a large would have been better I think. Next time I order I will order a large, maybe that will fell a little better.
__label__2 Good.: its a fun game, but a little confusing at first but then you get the hang of it. graphics i feel could of been a lot better. i consider it a hassle to aim the gun every time you play or having to set up the infrared sensors. The gun is not cordless whitch was not appealing, together with the gun color(bright orange). other than that is a fun game to play.
__label__1 Superficial and short-lived.: If you think that playing this game will fulfill any of your overly nostalgic memories of playing Time Crisis at the local Golfland, then you'd be sadly mistaken. The gun does not seem very accurate, and has somewhat of a lag time between where you aim it on the screen and where the reticle appears. Plus the arcade-shooting portion of the game is very, very short. The added FPS mode is insipid, and feels like it was just tacked on to make this a complete game. All-in-all, just a two-star product. I would only purchase this if Amazon (which is rockingly awesome) had it for about $30 again.
__label__2 Almost perfect: My copy of Electric wizard's Come my Fanatics was supposed to come with a bonus 7" called "Demon Lung". The record sleeve even has the lyrics to the song printed inside. The product description said it would come with it. I guess its okay though. I would prefer to have that 7", but the LP itself is wonderful, so I'm not hatin'.
__label__1 Another Save the Wild Horses Book!!!: Why does it seem that the horse story get's twisted into the youth of this country. This is More Propaganda to save the wild horses. I am tired of this agenda being fed to my children
__label__2 GREAT SELLER & UNIQUE PRODUCT: I loved this product. It brings out the heart of the New Orleans and the surrounding areas. I would recommend this product to those who crave the tastes of this region but live out of town. Nice coverage of the local food products that make this area famous. Good job to John Folse!
__label__1 usb hard drive adapter: used 1 time. the connector was bent upon arrival and had to be bent back in to shape to properly connect to the hard drive pins. I would say the cord is pore. the power supply would not power up the 2nd time i went to use the adapter. (still on the first day) I would not recommend buying this particular adapter.
__label__1 Waste Of Money: I bought this product last week ( 6/17/2012) The Ide works great, but the Sata is junk. I can only assume that the usb does not provide enough power to support a Sata drive. Do not waste your time or money on this. Spend a little extra cash on a Acronis adapter.
__label__1 poor construction: I am on my second adapter. On the first one, one of the wires for the IDE power plug came loose. They were very good about replacing the unit. On the second one the plug that fits into the ac power adapter is loose and I have to hold it so the power to the drive stays on. On both units the pins for the IDE to SATA power converter are loose and wiggle around making it hard to fit into the power cord. Overall I would say that this product is poorly made. I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__1 Good looking but useless: This wrench is not working at all. When I got it, I figure that I need to buy a handle, then I tried the handle together with this wrench. Guess what? I can only unlock the filter and couldn't lock it....? The people in the auto parts store, laugh out loud at me....after i told them how how I paid for it. The expense to send it back can let me buy a useful one from the store. .....VERY DISAPPOINTED.
__label__1 Sounds do not match at all!!: I just received this soundbox. The sounds for boxes that ARE supposed to match DO NOT, and the sounds for different boxes that ARE NOT supposed to match DO. Kind of surprised as this is not rocket science.This product, I should add, is well made. The boxes are sturdy, light, and easy for small hands to hold onto. Both my 2.5 yo and my 9 month old enjoyed picking up and rattling the boxes. However, it still does not do what it says it does, match sounds and then be able to check your performance by color matching.It's going right back from where it came!
__label__2 my first phish CD and still my fave...: This is CD is incredible. 'you enjoy myself' and 'fee' are 2 of their greatests. if you've never heard phish, take a chance on Junta...
__label__1 Leaking LaCrosse Chinese boots: The left boot had a leak right out of the box, not a big leak but enough to make my sock wet. Made in China tells the story. At one time LaCrosse boots were well made and had a long life, now I get anywhere from six months to one year use out of them.
__label__1 Sugar Recipes?!: There are recipes in the back of the book that call for up to a cup of sugar! Yeah, white sugar. Need I say more? It makes no sense.
__label__2 Not a magic bullet, but close: This book is not a magic bullet to ending food cravings. You still have to be motivated to change your lifestyle and eating habits. It does present the most reasoned arguments I have ever come across in a nutrition or "diet" book and the advice Dr.Barnard gives seems to be out of genuine concern and well-informed. Many other nutrition books I have read are almost abusive in their approach and language toward the dieter. Dr.Barnard uses a sensible, logical, and caring approach that really works as long as you are committed.
__label__2 Amazing source of information: This is a great book for those who are interested in becoming vegan. Even if you aren't, it provides some really interesting information on why we crave the foods we do. For the person who said we crave meat and cheese because we need the "nutrients" in them, you obviously didn't read this book and you're still hypnotized by the propoganda from the meat and dairy industries. These foods are not necessities. The author clearly states that a supplement is only necessary if you feel you're not getting enough B12. If you don't have enough time to cook the recipes provided in the book then buy a good vegan cookbook or look on the internet. If you're serious about changing your life then you'll find a way to do it. I'm so tired of hearing the "I don't have time to do it" excuse. This is why North America became fat in the first place. Anyway, this is a great book and I recommend it 100%. GO VEGAN!
__label__2 how could you not live Jimmy Smith: Aaaah, the sound of a B3... sounds from my past.. from the 60s and 70s mostly. This is a good one with classic Smith sounds.
__label__1 Worthless: The notation for this book is awful. Completely different from three other math books that I have used before. It doesn't adequately explain its own examples, even for the 1 chapter review on ODEs confused me as to what they were trying to accomplish. I gave up on it shortly after that. Even browsing wikipedia is more useful than this book.Cons: Hard to understand; doesn't seem to use standard notation from what I've read.Pros: Cheap. Seems to have a lot of material?
__label__1 Great Voice! But lousy album....: It isn't so much the production or Barry's wonderful voice that drags this album down, but rather the list of tunes he covers. "We Are The Champions", "Hip to Be Square"? Please, Barry is much more deserving than that. He should have covered half of Husker Du's "New Day Rising" album, segue with Kraftwerk's "Pocket Calculator" and then round the whole thing out with Joy Division's "Insight".Now that would have been an album. Than again, I didn't produce Mr Williams album, so all we are left with is this lack luster disappointment.
__label__1 This guy has no talent what-so-ever.: I feel sick that they categorized this never-was with Dave Matthews Band. People should be ashamed to own this album, much less suggesting that it should be album of the year.
__label__1 This is a joke right?: When I first saw this I thought, wow, Greg Brady is doing a Weird Al thing, kind of a spoof/parody/joke...Then I listened to it ... and low and behold! I do believe he's serious! Hmmm.. will this go gold? Will he do a reunion tour with the rest of the Brady's? A duet with Marsha? A rap song with Alice? Oh the possibilities! The vocal stylings of Greg Brady, just what we need to usher in the new millenium.
__label__1 Piece of Junk: I got this for a party and tested it out and it worked fine. Then the day of the party I noticed it ran for about 5 minutes then stopped spinning. If I shook it and toggled the switch a few times it would start going again. Yeah, that's really a fun thing to do during a party. I tried everything to fix it. I tried 3 different new batteries. I opened it up and reconnected all the wires. I sprayed it with WD40. I tried it both upside down and on the stand. I never could get it to go for more than 5 minutes. Don't waste your time on this piece of junk.
__label__2 Perfect!: I ordered these for centerpieces for one of our annual work events. The disco balls run off of 1 "D" battery (which is included) and the pin spots need to be plugged in. The pin spots are about the length of my hand and the diameter of my fist, they are of surprisingly excellent quality. I won't be using them for these centerpieces as there is not a plug at each table. After reading other reviews I was nervous about the quality of the disco balls, but out of the 18 I ordered every one of my disco balls spin and only one lost a mirror tile, but it was directly next to the mount and no one will ever notice it is missing.I highly recommend these.
__label__2 Inspiring: This book was a remarkable story of a woman's strength. As I recall the shooting of over 20 years ago, I remember how eventually we all went on with our lives and didn't think about the ways in which one young man with a gun changed so many lives forever that day at the Hilton Hotel in DC. Sarah Brady made it her personal mission to put the NRA out of business to keep us all safe from the senseless gun violence that changed her life forever. I would recommend this book to anyone who is inspired by the dedication and will of others and would like to change the world for the better.
__label__1 be careful when you buy this: Be sure you are purchasing the correct product. Supplier IDigToys will only accept returns within 14 days of purchase.
__label__1 Coming apart at the seams: I bought these shoes for my four year old son, and they became an instant favorite. He wore them almost everyday. Unfortunately, after about a month of wear, the "teeth" are wearing away and the seam down the back of the boot has ripped. After the application of a little super glue, he can wear them again, but next time I buy rainboots-which will be soon considering these are coming apart at the seams-I will look for another brand.
__label__1 Don't get tricked: I bought this thinking I could trust the reviews! I was wrong this was one of the worst movies I had ever seen. I love martials arts films I have all the jet's and bruce's I could find. This is just horrible. The action and lack of was worse than A kindergarden play with adults. It is set in modern times even though the cover as ancient times and there are nude scenes but they aren't even good. Its a real rip off!!! Do not get this movie unless you just have money to waste!!!!!!
__label__2 great book: Doc is sassy as ever. This of all the books in the series is so far the one that I reread the most.
__label__2 A very enjoyable read. Shepherd is a delight!: Shepherd's passion may be tomatoes, but rather than spending his whole life weeding or watering, the author shows us how his hobby has enabled him to develop relationships neighbors, friends and total strangers. It is a very enjoyable boo
__label__2 Entertaining and Absorbing: I read "Casey's Revenge" during a a recent trip to Jacksonville, and it completely distracted me from the rather boring ride. I found the characters (especially Casey) to be believable and sympathetic (the good guys, that is!). The initial scenes when Casey is stranded are quite creepy, and the ending is chilling! I especially liked Casey's resourcefulness and generally tough nature. The Savannah setting is well developed and adds a nice regional touch. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone wanting a captivating suspense novel with some local color. Take it on YOUR next trip!
__label__1 Awful. Mostly maltodextrin.: We ran out of Jolly Time and picked this up at the store. Tastes bad and is mostly maltodextrin, which causes stomach upset for most of my family. Avoid if you don't like maltodextrin.
__label__1 Bland, Very Bland: I bought this to try with the newly bought hot air pop-corn, but to say it is bland is an understatement. I haven't tried it with steamed vegetables yet, but it just doesn't make sense to me that I'd have to spray butter on the popcorn so I can have the butter-salt seasoning to stick. No pun intended.
__label__1 Butter seasoning that has no butter flavor: It doesn't have a butter flavor.It doesn't have much of a salt flavor either.So. It doesn't taste like butter and you need to add salt. The only thing it has going for it is that it is gluten free.The subscribe and save price is good. Better than you can get at the store by quite a bit. I bought my single bottle at the big box store for about 2.78 so if you can get it for less with S&S; then it is a good deal price wise.Be sure you buy a single one at the store before you invest in a 6 pack.
__label__2 Never been in an inter-racial relationship but...: I enjoyed reading Tag and Renee's story. In some ways I can see where Renee would be hesitant to be seen with Tag in public. I know when I actually went out with a White friend of mine and another girl, I felt VERY uncomfortable because I didn't want the attention. I didn't want people to think that I was dating him. All it was was a great game of bowling. But even still, it felt weird. I can read stories and watch movies like "Something New" till the cows come home but I don't ever want to experience it. He has to look damn good like Tag before I can even say "I'll think about it". Otherwise, this book was really good just like the other BJ books I've read.
__label__2 A quick and enjoyable read...: If you are a fan of standard issue Silhouette and Harlequin books, then you will enjoy Ms. Jackson's new book. The author aderes to this genre's basic formula, but with a little twist. The IR theme added a little flava to the book and I read it in one sitting. Renee is a social worker and Tag is one of Manhattan's most eligible bachelors. Despite the color difference, they decide to persue a relationship with each other. This decision leads to malicious gossip by coworkers and has Renee rethinking whether she wants to remain involved with Tag. Tag does his best to put her at ease, but Renee ultimately has to come to terms with the implications of their relationship on her own. Does she follow her heart or bow down to what society dictates is proper. Delaney's Desert Sheikh was far better, but this book did not disappoint me.
__label__2 Don't blame Showtime: The two reviews before mine say that Out of Order was one of the best shows on tv but complain that only the pilot episode is on the dvd. The reason for this has nothing to do with Showtime being greedy. The pilot is also owned by Hallmark, the other episodes are not. Hallmark has a distribution deal with a large video chain (rhymes with RockLuster), so it had to be done this way. If this DVD does well the remaining episodes will follow. This pilot received rave reviews (and made the NY Times list of Best 10 programs of 2003) and should not be penalized because only the pilot is available (so far.) The pilot stands alone and is awesome. Check it out.
__label__1 So disapointed !: Je viens de recevoir le DVD et à ma grande surprise, ce n'est que le pilote ! Bad information...there's nothing in the purchase of the DVD that says its only the pilot ! What about the six episodes ! The pilot is good but i want more !!
__label__2 Good deal: These cubbies are really sturdy for the size. But don't expect to put too much of anything inside because they are small. The color looks more like a deep dark brown rather than a mahogany, but the are still worth the money. They look like they cost more than they do.
__label__2 A book to make you sit up and pay attention: What a magnificent collection of weird shit. From A (for Abominable Snowman) to Z (for Ernst Zundel and his chronicles of secret Nazi Polar Expeditions) this is an amazing compendium of the weird, wacky and wonderful. Phantom ships, Flying Saucers, rains of fish, frogs found entombed in stone (alive) and most meticulously referenced. Anyone with an interest in Fortean phenomena needs to have this book. The perfect addition to any toilet bookshelf.This is a book that deserves to be left open and handy somewhere. When you can't sleep in the middle of the night, it is perfect for browsing and for making sure you really won't get back to sleep.An incredible collection of facts, innuendo and wit, sure to amaze and enthrall anyone interested in 'the damned facts' '
__label__2 Pod is good: Do yourself a favor and put down the Sleater-Kinney c.d's and what not and pick this mutha up. A truly mezmerising c.d that melancholonizes( its not a real word I know) the hell out of you. Flawlessly crafted , and if you know anything about Deal's work, emotionally stirring. Her voice will enter your ears and never leave, as you ask yourself why you never knew that 'pod' existed way back in 1990. Like that year itself, this album feels almost like it never existed, in any case it should evoke odd emotional responses.
__label__2 A Pleasent Surprise: This is a lot different than the Pixies which I wasn't expecting. The songs and subject matter are a lot darker (which is cool) and the production is cold and distant (which is also cool). The songs are much more bass driven, which is fine because Kim's a great bass palyer, and the instrumentation is very spare. The use of strings in songs like "When I was a Painter" and the spine-tinglingly good "Oh!" really works and raises the songs to a new level. Also it turns out that Kim is amazing singer, I don't know why she didnt sing lead much in the Pixies. I mean I knew she was good but she really breaks your heart into a million pieces. In conclusion if your a fan of the Pixies or amazing rock music in general you're gonna want this, just dont expect this to sound exactly like the Pixies.
__label__2 Songs for spiritual healing!: Very good music and songs written and performed for the healing of hearts. I love [Listen, Listen, Listen] & [Return Again] very much, and often used them during the opening and closing of spiritual group gatherings. People listen to the songs in such an atmosphere and concentration often get in touch with the bottom of the heart and tears coming up because they are really [moved].
__label__2 A Sharp Kitchen Tool: We have a set of Paula Deen knives that have never been impressively sharp. Then I decided to let the AccuSharp Sharpener work its magic on those knives. And magic it is. The difference between the sharpened and unsharpened steak knives is readily evident and impressive.The sharpener is easy to use as it glides smoothly over the knife blade. Once sharpened, the difference of the edge can be seen and felt immediately. The small expense of this sharpener was money well spent.
__label__2 Simple is often better.: I bought this product for myself a year ago in desparation looking for something to sharpen a wide variety of favorite kitchen knives. I have tried all of the other techniques from stones to powered knife sharpeners. As one who likes a sharp knife when cooking, I just wanted something to dress the edge quickly, reliably, and as often as I wanted to without a lot of hassle. After doing my research on the Internet, I decided to try this a year ago. It is nothing short of great. It met all my criteria and now we always have sharp cutlery no matter what type straight or serrated edge. I even use it on my meat clever. I liked it so much that all my family members are getting them as stocking stuffers for Christmas this year. I'll never have to complain about dull knives when I am cooking at their houses. As a gag, we stapled a few band-aids on the card before gift wrapping the sharpener. It's not a professional sharpening tool, but it is quick, practical, and a real timesaver.
__label__2 Amazing...: I didn't expect this to work for so low a price, but I was simply amazed at how well it gets the job done. There's not much more to say other than that it works exactly as described: two or three swipes and the knife is like new. I restored a 30 year old knife with 8 swipes, 3 swipes for knives of more recent vintage. Unbelievable.
__label__2 does the job!: awesome sharpener for axes, machetes, and for some knives. i wouldn't use this sharpener on a nice knife because it leaves a pretty rough cut and you could potentially ruin a nice blade. this sharpener cuts a dull edge very quickly and was worth every penny. highly recommended for most sharpening.
__label__1 Not sure that it works: Tried to sharpen my scissors, and the tool made them even more blunt. I followed the instructions on how to use...
__label__2 Excellent Sharp Knifener for the Price: I was very pleased to find that this simple little device does an excellent job of making sharp knives. Rather than moving the knife through the sharpener, you hold the knife stationary and run the sharpener across the knife a few times. Don't wast your money on some expensive prax electric knife sharpener; try this sharp knifener, you'll like it, especially at such a low price!
__label__2 Great deal, effective product: As soon as I got it, I started sharpening away the several knives that have been dull for way too long. My pocket knife is back into action with a sharp edge, which only took me minutes to recondition. Affordable and effective for sharpening multi purpose knives.
__label__1 Save your time and money: I fundamentally agree with the Kirkus Review. Instead of keeping you on the edge of your seat Saylor keeps you asleep in your seat. In no manner can he (in the case of this book) be compared with Caleb Carr. All too often during the development of his plot does he take off on lengthy detours that totally destroy whatever tension or suspense that he is trying to develop i.e. the Female Clerks Bill. The book finally gets moving at the beginning of Part III on page 225. O. Henry's position as a protaganist is minimal. The conclusion is predictable as Saylor pretty much broadcasts it throughout the book. All in all a tedious and boring book.
__label__2 Good Songbook: This is a good P/V/G songbook. I play guitar and the chord diagrams are listed above the staff. I'm having fun learning to play some of Avril's songs. Because some of the chords are complicated (no pun intended), I suggest that this is good for an intermediate player.
__label__1 Much too skimpy: I bought this book and would advise you not to do so. It is much too skimpy. There is too much fluff. There are much better books and articles around. This book touches on a bunch of terms and techniques without explaining them in sufficient detail. I thought that by reading this book I would gain a good idea of how to use Rose, but such was not the case.
__label__1 not true: If you are a fan of fictional genocides, this is a good read. If you are interested in the complete truth, you have to read other books. In the period mentioned in the book, practically everybody was killing everybody else in a country torn by ethnic strife fueled by imperialist foreigners. Innocent ethnic Greeks were killed, yes, but keep in mind that lots of innocent Turks also perished. Calling this kind of nightmare a "genocide" is just an inappropriate use of the word.
__label__1 It was jihad: What a pity that Halo could not, not even now, name the annihilators. The "turkish military"? It was Islam.This kind of perfect dhimmitude is Islam's greatest achievement, the complicity of their victims.
__label__2 Poignant memoir: This poignant memoir written in such astonishing detail is an unforgettable story that will capture the reader from the start. Sano is like a small but sturdy flower growing in the most unlikely and least advantageous of garden spots. In her we see goodness and love survive heart rending loss and the cruel displacement of senseless war. I could not put the book down once I began to read it.
__label__2 Buy This Record!: You've found it! Buy this record! Linda Ronstadt and the Ray Santos orchestra perform Latin swing music! The arrangements are crystal clear, snappy and crisp. Her voice, her Spanish phrasing, is flawless. The song selection, Frenesi, Perfidia, is inspired; not a mediocre number in the bunch! Do you like to dance? You can't sit still for this music. This is not the canciones mariachi music (fine in its own right, I'm sure). For some reason, people don't know about this record. I had them play it in a CD store recently - the employees didn't want me to buy it and take it away! You'll thank me for this one!
__label__1 Outdated: This book is racist, Eurocentric, and outdated. Professor Huntington would be well advised to consider that civil conflicts outside the Global North are more than a bunch of silly little children waving threatening sticks.
__label__1 Shows author's bias and borders on conspiracy theory: This book is a bad read. Book does show that the author has vast knowledge of world history and geography but at the same time brings out his strong biases towards racial and religious make-up of the world. The book makes some very simplistic judgments about the historical nature of conflicts and adds huge amount of weights towards some abstract "civilizational" construct of human life. Humans are way more complicated and driven a lot by nationalistic and regional concerns than depicted in this book. I found reading this book quite a waste of time.
__label__1 Somebody give Huntington a copy of "Orientalism.": This book is racist, essentialist garbage. Strange how Huntington's thesis fails to account for Saudi Arabia, the most fundamentalist of Islamic states and client of U.S. power
__label__2 Revenge of the Goldfish - Inspiral Carpets: Even after a few years, this album still sounds great to my ears. I recall the day I heard "Dragging me down" on a "Live to Air" radio broadcast from a local bar a radio station I grew up listening to over the border in Toronto was doing and it was a great tune. From then on I purchased this album and have been a fan ever since, other notable tracks on this album which in my opinion are solid are "Two Worlds Collide, Bitches Brew and Disappeared." I would definitely suggest if you are a fan of the alternative movement from the 90s this should be included in your library of CDs.
__label__1 Do not buy a book without flipping it.: That's what happened to me respect this book. Conclusion: DO NOT BUY ANY BOOK, EVER, WITHOUT FLIPPING IT. OTHER'S REVIEW ARE NOT RELIABLE. This is the third time I bougth a book based on other's review. I repented.
__label__2 Great: Have used this for many little ones. Always a hit. You can't go wrong with this for your own use or as a gift.
__label__2 Love this DVD set!!: I got this DVD set as a baby shower gift before my son was born. It is a wonderful set of dvd's that I used from infant age until about 3 years old. My little boy loved to watch it and it is easy to watch as an adult too. When my brother was expecting in September of last year I could not wait to give them the dvd set for Christmas. It helps to calm a baby and relieve a tired parent. Recommend it 100% to everyone.
__label__2 Close your eyes and let it carry you away...: If you liked the African-flavored tracks on the soundtrack to Disney's "The Lion King", you will love this album. Not being an expert, I don't know whether or not this is "authentic" African music, but I can tell you that it is some of the most emotionally stirring music I've heard. The rhythms and harmonies totally sweep you away. I've tried to use this CD as background music to study by, and it doesn't work because I just have to sit back and lose myself in the music; needless to say, my work never got done until I turned it off and put in something a little bit less involved. This is definitely a purchase that you won't regret.
__label__2 Print Explosion 3.0: I have used this program for years on my Mac. I had to upgrade to use it with Leopard. It's a great product.
__label__1 Hands down worst program/support I have ever had!: I bought this program because of the great reviews I read on Amazon. I have been sorely disappointed. Some of the major issues are that it freezes my Mac (that is well above the system requirements for the software), has a fatal error and shuts down every time I use the program, and none of the templates do what they claim they will do. Other issues are that when printing an image, many times it will print the image on six different pages even though it shows in the print preview it will print on one page. I have tried dealing with the support and the response (when I finally get one) is that it should work. They have no idea how to help me other than to say delete the program and reload it. They said they would look into it, but that was 5 months ago and I'm still waiting. I would recommend you not waste your money.
__label__2 Ultimate Treehouses: Looking at this book is perfect for day dreamers like me. It shows the most amazing possibilities for many types of treehouses. I haven't gotten to the point of reading the practical information but it is there for when I need it.
__label__1 misleading: advertisements, brought as (little) info: I know it's just a tiny booklet, but I have found the title distinctly misleading, and would never recommend it to anyone who is really interested in getting to know even a little bit more about multimedia. There are hardly any 'essentials' in this booklet, and the 'tips' seem to refer more to what the highlighted manufacturers must be providing to the publisher for zooming in on their various products. There is no more info on multimedia to be found in these pages than on the boxes and wrappings of the products themselves, and so you're better off just having a look in a store, where you can at least make your own picks.
__label__2 A well-written scholarly account: Obviously this book will have a small audience, as the average American has little interest in the history of Polish nationalism. But for any who are interested in Polish history or in nationalist movements in general, this is an interesting book. What I would say separates it from many other academic works is its readability, as the author has a very nice way with words.
__label__1 Terrible Game: This game feels like some amateurs produced it. Takes forever to load, gameplay is awful. This is what makes people hate 1st person shooters. Your squadmates get killed for never moving, AI is stupid, aliens are dreadful. In sum, if you buy it, you will waste your money.
__label__1 Artifical, overwhelming, tangy. More like a cheap perfume: I was reluctant to purchase scent diffuser online, but did, based on the reviews, which were unanimous. There isn't much sense in reviewing a product whose appeal depends on personal taste. I wanted, however, to correct the impression that the scent is pleasant and likeable by default, i.e., has a very broad appeal. I certainly disagree.Lesson learned.
__label__2 Good for the price: I used this with my sewing machine for real leather sewing and worked just fine. The price and packaging is good too.
__label__2 A great therapy source for APD: The author, Rosner, provides great suggestions for clinicians working with clients who have an auditory processing disorder.
__label__1 Not worth it: This is a 2 DVD (Nick Warren Mix; Saeed and Palash Mix + interviews) + 1 CD set (same Nick Warren mix than the 1st DVD): by the way, in my DVD the CD side was not detected even though i could hear it on my CD player. Well, the review: I spent like 2 months waiting to find this DVD, and when i finally got it......it was a big dissapointment!. Yes, Nick Warren is one of my favorite DJ's, but this DVD is his worst work. Maybe the mix is "not that bad" (Personally, i think that the one from Saeed and Palash is better). From what i think they had better released it as normal audio CD's as the images have no quality (looks like a home video of a discoteque with some poor computer graphics and some landscapes of Ibiza, with not a good edition, very very poor images), and also the interviews with Sasha and Tenaglia..well, i think that a 2 minutes segment in Entertainment Tonight is better.
__label__2 It does get harder...: This was the first game i owned for my PS2 so needless to say, I kept playing it. It has amazing graphics, solid (very cool) controls, good effects and music, and it is a great mulitplayer game. My gripe with The Bouncer is the length. It took me an hour to beat the first time, and every time I played through after that, trying to squeeze a few extra play hours before it go boring (it still hasn't)... it got increasingly frustrating. The bosses get tougher every time through, and if you choose characters in certain combinations, you can get new characters for multiplayer and new story pieces. So regardless of the length and ease of playing it through once, the game has a decent replay value and I recommend it as a first PS2 game.
__label__1 Going, Gone!: I will start off by saying SHORT. 2 Hrs max. The concept of building up your characters is nice but not worth playing through 3 times to max them out. Also the Story lines for each character aren't worth playing them through either. When you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all except for a few scenes and different phrases. The graphics are nice which they should be. Expected more from Square but wait I usually do......and they usually don't.
__label__1 bouncer= streets of rage with too much down time: i love squaresoft and this is a good game but the fact of the matter is that you'll spend 1-5 minutes playing the game followed by 2-6 minutes of video and story developement. the actual gameplay is a little sluggish and a let down. on the upside the graphics are a squaresoft standard of quality. so if you don't mind getting into a game and taking breaks every few minutes to watch cutsceens you'll probably like this one.
__label__1 WORST GAME EVER: squaresoft needs to stick to rpgs only. All you do is watch a movies, fight for 2 minutes, then watch a movie again, and then 45 minutes later the game is over. And the fighting sucks too, you just mash buttons and get double teamed. And you fight with two other guys, and if they kill enemies while you are not in control of them you dont get any experience. This game could have been so good, the characters and graphics are beautiful, but it seemed like squaresoft decided that gameplay did not matter at all. They could not pay me to play this game ever again. Worst game I ever played.
__label__1 Did not live up to the hype: As many Squaresoft fans did, this past weekend I purchased The Bouncer.All the advertisements and previews made it sound like game of the year. However, it was just a mindless beat-em-up with an okay storyline. I beat the game in 2 hours, and in one day I unlocked all the secrets. No challenge here at all.It was visually stunning, the first game to really harness the PS2's power. But as an avid Final Fantasy fanatic, I thought the gameplay was a poor job by Squaresoft
__label__1 Boring...: Good graphics, bad camera and boring fighting system make this game a real snooze-a-rama. This game is worse then the old arcade game, final fight. No weapons, no interactive backgrounds...even Gekido for PS1 has this.
__label__1 Too short, poor gameplay, terrible acting, dumb script...: I like fighting games, but this one is really bad. The many cut-scenes totally destroy the momentum of the game. The "acting" in those cut-scenes is soooooooooooooooo bad that it becomes funny (unintentionally, in a cult-movie sort of way)Worse: The fighting is slow and boring. The way the characters walk around is terrible. The AI is very dumb. There is no challenge whatsoever in this game: you don't need skill, you don't need wits, you just need patience to sit through this ordeal.
__label__2 The bouncer is a blast: The Bouncer is a short game but not a bad won. I think people are expecting more of an action game but it's really more of a fighting game. Think of The Bouncer as a fighting but with more than one person to fight at a time.
__label__1 Awsome look but game is very lacking: The movies and grafics are very well done, and over all the game looks nice, but the down side is that the game leads you by the nose from fight to fight, showing you what you do, without any control of movement or even what you say. It is basically watch a clip, and then fight.The first time through you can beat the game in about 2 to 3 hours, and its faster if you go though a second time.Rent this game before you even think of buying it. Then when you beat it a few times, you can decide if you want it or not.
__label__1 The Bouncer is a bigger disappoinment than NFL Gameday: This game is terrible. There is only like 1 and a half hours of gameplay, and like 4 hours of cutscenes. The combat system is no good, you can only do about 5 moves with each character (3). The storyline is terrible. A girl gets kidnapped and you have to go rescue her. The only good part about this game is the graphics. Bottomline is don't bother with this game, don't even rent it.
__label__2 Bounce youre way out of here: I should start out with saying that this game is not a traditional game from Squaresoft, it is like a jazzed up version of Streets of Rage or something. It has many good things about it, and many bad things.First off, graphics are amazing, and dialog sounds different instead of having that robotic sound to it. By all means this is a great game, it's got story, it's pretty fun, and it has the hugest replay value of any game ever.However, the game is extremely short, about an hour or two, depending if you skip movies or not. And after beating the game a few times, the only fun thing to do is battle it out with a few of your freinds. I would like to have seen more RPG elements in this game, instead of movies then fighting.If you want to showoff your playstation 2, or you have some freinds to fight with, then this game is for you. However, if you are more of an RPG-er and not much for just battle games, then just rent the game first.
__label__2 Added Security: Hadn't had any problems with my shed up north but wanted to beef up security a bit.Excellent product!! Like it a lot.
__label__2 Excellent book: This is a superb book - definitely in the tradition of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. It explores into the minds of men (not many women in this book) who find themselves by choice in dangerous parts of the world. Parts of this book though, are not for sensitive readers.
__label__2 stainless grill bars: Don't know about the flavorizor but they do the trick keeping excess drippings off the bottom of the grill and it diverts the flames evenly.
__label__1 wrong item description: The photo of this item shows a full set of bars. What you receive, however, is only 5 long bars.
__label__1 Is this a joke?: A floppy disk? Really? When's the last time anyone used a floppy disk for anything other than a coaster? I don't care how amazing this MicroCase software is, if it can't be adapted to a CD, then it's completely worthless.You can download the software at the Wadsworth Publishing website, but if you've got a Mac, forget it. Assuming you can find access to a PC, you can download the software, but there's still a CD that has workbook pages that you can't download without the floppy disk.Hopefully this publisher will enter into the 21st century soon, but until then, pray that your institution is smart enough to require a less archaic book with usable software.
__label__2 Awesome Book: Don't let the brevity of this book fool you. Packed in its small package is a ton of inspiration. I purchased this book in preparation for starting a new Boy Scout troop, but this is great for any father, mother, youth worker, grandparent, or anyone who ever comes into contact with children and youth.I've passed this on to other scout leaders to read. Its main message? Walk the walk and then encourage the young people who are watching you to do the same.
__label__1 The Not-So-Sillymarillion: I just didn't think it was funny. I love Tolkien and I love parodies, but this just didn't do it for me. I've read funnier parodies of Tolkien's work on fanfiction sites.I think the best word I can come up with for this book is "tired." And did I mention it wasn't funny?
__label__1 Horrid.: Tries to do too much and becomes tedious. Bored of the Rings was much superior in lampooning the work Lord of the Rings because the authors didn't try to do too much.
__label__2 Apsaras - Self Titled: Songs Include :1. "Apsaras" - 10:232. "Hizashi No Nakade ( Children Of The Sunshine )" 5:173. "Kinimo Tomenai ( Don't Turn Away )" 4:304. "Ashiitani ( The Search )" 5:205. "Misato" 5:366. "Aruhi No Kaze ( Journey With The Wind )" 9:55
__label__2 it rulez: this is just the best cd. if you like drum n bass, progressive dance music, or even if you like progressive hip hop, this is the sh*t! maybe if you don't like drum n bass, you will after hearing this. top notch production, awesome dj'ing and song selection, and sublime freestyle lyrical madness. i "sing" this stuff in the shower. it makes me happy to be alive. 'nuff said. after this, buy all the other ones too, they all rule: progression sessions with drs/blame, prog. sess. vol 2, vol. 1, Promised Land Vol. 1, you just can't get enuff. You're listening to the past, the present, and the future...
__label__2 Why buy anything else?: I am running those in my V8 5.0L (302) Ford and my V6 3.0L DOHC Ford. There is no question that iridum tip and platinum ground disc will last longer and maintain the same gap.Why would anybody buy anything else, especially when is so labor intesive to replace those in the first place?
__label__2 Album's Dream: One of the best albums ever, directly from the best times of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. FUll of rage, passion and... hear yourself.
__label__2 Definitely Worth a Listen: A frend of mine loaned me this CD four years ago, and I've yet to return it. Some dull spots, but enough rockin' beats to keep it in rotation. Swipe it if you can, buy it if you must, but add this one to the collection.
__label__2 Tried many, PIAA wins: I have tried many brands of bulbs over the years. PIAA comes in first. They are bright white, last a long time and well worth their higher price.
__label__1 The Color Book is not likely to be helpful.: The Color Book claims to have 11,264 color combinations for your home. I don't know how the publisher did the math, but you'll never squeeze more than a couple hundred combinations from this book. That may still sound like a lot, but it isn't. For each room, you get maybe 20 color combinations, and that's if you tear or cut out the pictures and assemble your own pictures from the snippets, which is what you'd have to do if you want to get any use out of this book. For a color, it gives at most three shades, which is far from adequate, since every brand of paint has at least 30 shades of any color, and using a different shade can give a totally different look.
__label__1 Do not buy!: I just drove through 45 minutes of traffic each way to pick up this filter after my first Marineland filter was discovered to have a structural defect. Soon after unpacking this filter, I discovered that a crucial part was missing and hence the entire filter system is useless!Save yourself the hassle and buy a system from a REPUTABLE manufacturer. NEVER again a Marineland product!
__label__1 A let down: I agree with most of the input stated by others, the album is a huge let down. This is very soft and popie compared to what they have produced in the past. It's not a bad album but if your a long time listener of FFAF be prepared for change. The screaming and fast guitar playing is not there.
__label__2 The best CD I own: This is, without a doubt, the best CD I own. Since I purchased this CD, I have purchased more than 20 additional CD's hoping to find one with as many excellent songs as this. No luck yet!
__label__1 What a freakin' sellout, man!!: This guy sold out many years ago, unfortunately. Like Crusty the Clown and Neil Young, Nick Cave puts his name on everything, as if the world is one big advertisement for his profit.Musically this album is pretty boring, pretty boring indeed, just like all other Cave's ventures into the netherworld of goth-rock. On the positive side, though, Cave sounds a tad more upbeat, so perhaps he's finally beaten back that hernia he's been suffering so many years.For true rock, check out the coming Limp Bizkit CD, plus I heard Van Halen has a new record coming soon. Is Roth back in the fold this time?HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 the best chair ever: This is the most comfortable chair you'll ever sit in. Its great for people who have back problems too. The chair is designed to fit the human body. The other great feature, is that the mesh lets rain pass through it and its almost instantly dry!! I love this chair!
__label__1 Owned for 4 years: I bought this off Amazon 4 years ago and while it is very comfortable it does not stand the test of time...within the first year it started to rust and the cording is very stretched out. I've had better luck with a cheaper knockoff I bought at BJ's.
__label__2 nORTON TOOL: The stone has the perfect shape. The large side is great for mower blades, and the tapper ends work well on pruners and axes. Easy to use and no injury to fingers. It's a 10.
__label__2 Please update this book!: I used "German in 32 Lessons" when learning German, and found it superior in many ways to other introductory books (and I looked at a lot of them).However, there are a number of shortcomings which make it less useful than it could be--shortcomings that could be easily remedied. First, there needs to be a section in the front of the book on pronunciation. Second, there needs to be an alphabetical list of vocabulary words in the back of the book. Third, it needs to be updated, some of the slang is a little outdated. Fourth, it would be great if it had an accompanying cassette or CD.If these four things were done, I think it would be BY FAR the best introductory language book on the market. It has great strengths--logical, bite-sized lessons, useful vocabulary, clear explanations of important grammar. But it needs a bit of tweaking. Adrienne, are you listening? W.W. Norton & Company, are you listening? Please update the whole series.
__label__2 When I got "hooked".: Rift was actually the first Phish album I ever heard. I believe everything from Junta to A Live One is great, but I think Rift really is possibly the finest one. Concept album or not, it just flows so well. From the openers "Rift", and then "Fast enough for you", to the excellent closer "Silent in the morning", every song is in the right place. And the mid-album tracks "Horn", "Wedge", and "Mound", are all fun jams too. As much as I enjoy The Dead, Blues Traveler, and Black Crowes, there's just something about Phish and Rift. It's just alot of phun!
__label__1 Rift - It's nothing great: Rift was the third Phish Album I bought following Farmhouse and Billy Breaths. And I must say that after listening to those two, rift is not all that great. I does however offer some great guitar work. But as with most Phish albums it lacks lyrical creativity. But I don't want to sell it short. Musically this is an all right album. So if you have some extra cash and you like Phish Go ahead check it out. Maybe you'll see something here that i didn't.
__label__2 No more insanity!: Trying to manage my pot lids was making me crazy. I have to stack some pots so leaving their lids on is not really an option and the resulting craziness of lids everywhere and always being in the way is now a distant memory! I have flat-like, stainless steel lids and this works phenomenally. Now I can finally stop pulling my hair out!
__label__2 STILL GOING ON STRONG.....CANT WAIT FOR THA NEXT ONE!!!: JA IS STILL MY NIG*A!!!...SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT SAY IT,WHEN JA WAS ALL OVER THA RADIO FROM 2000 TO AT LEAST 2002,MOST WAS FEALING HIM,AS TO NOW... WHEN 50 CAME ON THA SPOT MOST PEOPLE TURNED ON JA,AND JOIN 50 CENT BAND WAGON...NO DISS TO 50,JUST GETTING MY PIONT ACROSS.
__label__2 the best album of ja rule ever: I bought this album and its great.The best songs are:Last of the mohicansWonderfulNew YorkGet it startedR.U.L.E.Gun talkNever thoughtLife goes onWhere Im fromBout my business
__label__1 This is the same old ramble: Ja can't think of anything else to spit except the same old recycled garbage... he hasn't rapped about or said anything new in any of his cd's... I wouldn't spend a dime on this cd... but if you like no talent whiners then this is the cd for you.
__label__1 HE IS A WANKSTA AND I SMELL PUSSY: he just needs to retire. screw this non-gangsta. no real G sings, they just rap, GOD!
__label__2 Solid album!!: What a wonderful recording! One of the best to be released so far this year. I can't get it out of my cd player! This is "feel good" music, but not in a cheesy way. Good, up-beat pop rock. It's a nice cross between Anberlin's vocals, and Relient K's hooks, and lyrics that have a great message. You'll want to be singing along! Definitely check this out!
__label__1 Disappointing: When I picked this cd up at my local Christian bookstore, I had heard very few of Run Kid Run's songs. As I started to listen to the cd, I was expecting to be surprized by how good they were. As it was, I was slightly disappointed. This band is nothing new. They combine Relient K's music with vocals from Green Day, Hawk Nelson, Olivia the Band and Relient K. That's it. All of the songs sound the same, and nothing stands out. The one song I like Is Wake Up, Get Out. Over all, This Is Who We Are is not worth the 14 bucks I paid for it.
__label__1 its ok but not worth the money: It looks cool but we haven't really had reason to use it much.The burner is really affected by wind. I tried to stir-fry on it and the wok didn't even get hot after 20 minutes because it was a little windy out. If I could do it again, I would not get it.The summit 650 grill is great though!
__label__2 Sci-fi Trip Exploration of Identity and Self-loathing: This is a pretty fascinating book. It's about this paid assassin who wanders around the galaxy on an assigment to kill clones, and having to impersonate a different personage or infiltrate a different society at each stop. The guy is a matricide/patricide too, and we get this very inventive sort of travelogue of different societies and identities he goes through, never really knowing the point of his mission, but eventually getting to a place called Pleasure Land where he's supposed to whack the kingpin, and a nice surprise ending ensues. The most interesting part is when he has to be a god, a criminal, a monk, an ambassador and what not, and the incredible scene where the mob boss explains his philosophy of lying openly to the women he lies to. The writing is really good, and it really keeps you turning the pages, and unlike most scifi these days it makes you think. I recommend this book very highly.
__label__1 Seems like a different set: After seeing the butterfly cups, I really thought the saucers would be just as nice. They don't even look like they are out of the same set.
__label__2 helpful to this R.S.: Can be helpful to anyone who panics at the now-popular idea that we must "find our one true passion or mission in life" when there are so many ideas we'd rather pursue, and so many new ones we haven't even thought of yet. Some people just are not wired to focus on a limited number of activities & interests, and that's ok.
__label__1 What's with all the good reviews?: This is where the band as well as most 80's bands began to commercialize their sound. This is rock music.. plain and simple and this has nothing to make this considered metal. Sorry, but I don't see what the fuss is about...this CD sucked. Anthrax with Joey Belladonna is where the band really shined and was real metal. Yeah, I admit the whole rap thing sucked horribly but still for the most part Anthrax was truly heavy band with Joey but with John...they really slowed down.
__label__1 too good to be true: I thought what a great bargain I found this movie I totally loved. but when i got the product it could be watched on my Blu-Ray Dvd player as it was made for another region. The company should notify you when your ordering that it won't work on american blu-players as it is made for another region. Which this is the first time I heard about not being able to watch a movie cause what region it is from. The site should explain about why there movies don't work on USA dvd players.
__label__2 love this movie: Great movie!I didn't know what to expect but ended up enjoying every minute of it! Some of the humor is slap you in the face funny while other parts are quite subtle and touching. I've seen it twice and will be watching it again!Fun movieI'm sorry that this movie didn't get the rave reviews that Greek Wedding did, because this was a fun, forget-your-troubles movie. I never got bored and my tickle bone loved it, too.Also Recommended: Greek Wedding, to wang foo thanks for everything
__label__2 Power of One continues: The prospect of reading 900 plus pages was a daunting task but one which became progressively easier as I became engrossed in the book. Courtenays strength lies in his vivid use of words. Powerful always comes to mind when I think of him as an author.As with The Power of One it does not pay to consider the likelihood of the plot too deeply. We all need a hero " which is what fiction is all about. Like previous comments, two things grated: namely rehashing the Power of One plot for new readers and the lack of continuity at times where the flow did not seem to be there. Both detracted from the book.That said, it was a very good read and one I wouldnt have wanted to miss.
__label__2 Wonderful movie!: Being in the USNavy myself, I have met and known many Navy SeaBee's. I greatly enjoyed watching this John Wayne movie. I respect the "Can Do" reputation of these individual's even more now.
__label__1 The Real Seabees: John Wayne is terrific, as always. From the standpoint of telling the story of the Seabees role in WW2, this movie is well worth watching. But the plot and love story were very Hollywood-ized and silly. And William Frawley doing calistenics is laughable.
__label__1 This thing sucks: First of all, I had a hell of a time finding a lug nut that would fit under it. Once installed, it fell off once but I found it. Then after the winter it came time to rotate my tires and the lock was jammed. Luckily, it only took the back of a hammer and about 2 minutes to pry the whole thing apart. Proving it worthless but saving me a lot of trouble.
__label__1 Crappy lock: Very poor quality. Dont buy it. It doesnt lock well. The key is poor quality. Just a bad product. Oh my gosh, its forcing me to write twenty words for the review, but being so wordy, it will not be clearly stated. Its CRAP!
__label__1 What a waste: I would have to agree that this book is nothing but common knowledge with commentary. I could have written this book! Come on! It doesn't even give "how-to's" or anything worth spending the time viewing. Very disappointed. This is the worst 17 bucks I've ever spent.
__label__2 Powerful, alluring, amusing, tragic...: Cave and the Seeds are the proteges of no one. Unique and inexplicable, what first sounds like a jangling garage band becomes more and more profound with each listen. Many people may be considering buying this because of the prevalence of the swooning, excellent Red Right Hand. And although that is the finest song on this album, everything else is of such exquisite quality that you're certain to find a new favorite. Do You Love Me? is powerful and irresistable; Nobody's Baby Now is quiet and majestic; I Let Love In is hilarious and miserable at the same time, and permanently infectious; and Do You Love Me? (II) is unforgettable. If you're looking for something easy to listen to, I cannot recommend this; I refrain from giving it 5 stars only because it is such an acquired taste. But once your in Cave's world, you'll never want to go back.
__label__1 Make sure it set up properly.: I had this last week and was very excited to show up at the back yard under morning sun. Unfortunately, one screw was broken anyhow and I didn't notice. It is just fine. After two to three times on/off, and turn back on the chair I was amazingly falling down to the deck floor like slippery on the ice. That is it.Now, it is working fine and lovely. But the back is still in pain.
__label__1 not for the RVer: Booklet only describes the downhill grades. I am interested in how steep the uphill side is, and can only attempt to read the descriptions in reverse. Pub also missed some fairly steep grades in Wy and Ut on 80. Booklet would be worth the money if a bit more detailed and consistent verbage. Remember we RVers need to know about uphill grades.
__label__2 Love the rechargable battery: I have had this monitor for over 2 years and it works great. My favorite feature is the rechargable battery (our old one had AA batteries so we always kept it plugged in). We plug this one in at night in our bedroom and let it charge, then all day we can take it where ever we are, living room, downstairs, outiside... Also because of this I have found no need to have a double reciever (something we had to have with our old one because we could leave one plugged in downstairs, and one upstairs.) Love the monitor... I guess I only gave it 4 stars because I don't actually think you need all the channels... it seems no matter which one it is on you still get some static at times. Would buy again for sure (but after 2 years ours is still going strong.)
__label__2 Love 'Em!!: Finally a product from Fisher Price that is worth the money!! These are the second set of Fisher Price monitors we have purchased and are loving them - unlike the first set. We especially love having 10 different channels to select from, reception display, battery display, rechargable batteries, low battery alarm, terminal/reciever disconnection alarm, and most of all clear sound and NO static. We struggled for months with another model of monitors from Fisher Price and ultimately ended up purchasing these upon recommendation from family. We are glad to ditch the other ones and are completely happy with these!!
__label__2 Mostly Good: This monitor is pretty good. It pick up my little one's little noises so I can get to her before she awakens. It does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then 4 bars (which it is less then 4 bars most of the time as my house is long). I do have high praise for the Fisher Price exchange service. I had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor didn't use it until after the 30 day return allowance from Amazon was up. Then after about 6 hours of use the monitor stopped working. I was able to send it to Fisher-Price and they exchanged it in less then ten days! (no questions asked)
__label__2 This is not a parody: If you like weird alternative rock, or alternative alternative rock, you will probably like this album. This album got me interested in Ween. The first three songs seem to have the most emotion put into them (Little Birdy, Tender Situation, The Stallion Pt.3). After that Gene and Dean sound more silly for the most part (with the exception of 'Sarah', which sounds like a pretty ode). The silliness works best in the tune 'Don't Get 2 Close 2 My Fantasy' (which sounds similar to a song by the seventies band Bachmann-Turner Overdrive). Overall, there is something interesting about each song on this album. It is a work of creativity.
__label__2 Viva Guava!: This is an important album to own if you enjoy trippy music. I am a big fan of Ween but feel particularly strong about "turning on" those who like to "turn on" to its chemical-induced brilliance. Deep behind the effects, there's the same vocal and guitaristic brilliance Gene and Dean give us live....but all your blunted ears need to know is the mind between them will be blown.
__label__2 Must read!: I too read this book as a teen and am now 54 years old. I remember it so well and have suggested it to many young people interested in the medical field or just for a good read.
__label__1 Too many factual inaccuracies and misleading instructions: This book has some potentially useful information, particularly suggestions about different scent combinations. However, it has numerous factual inaccuracies - you should insulate your soap to ensure proper cooling??? Fragrance oils used for soap are alcohol-based??? Crayons to color soap??? Some of the recipes involve extremely expensive essential oils that are cost prohibitive (vanilla & rose for example) and the amounts recommended would require mortgaging your home. The methodology of soap making is antiquated - no mention of using a stick blender instead of hand stirring, for example. There are much better choices out there such as Susan Miller Cavitch's book (dated but still useful) and Alicia Grosso's Everything Soap Book.
__label__2 Awesome! Pure Energy: I must say this is a great song. The lyrics r original and the beat is very uplifting. The song is so good that i wish it could have been longer. I give this CD-Single 4 stars not because the song deserves it but because it lacks remixes. But altogether it is worth having if u r a truly Eurodance Fan. Dont miss it!!!
__label__2 Phenomenal. It's a shame they broke up.: It's a wonder that the Story never became a huge phenomenon. Perhaps they were recording too pre-Lilith. These two are phenomenally talented, with beautiful voices and music. It's a shame that they only have two albums to grace us with.
__label__2 Great folk sounds: This album is a pleasure for ears. The genuine and intimate folk sound of The Story is a complete success.It's sad that Jonatha Brooke moved away from this, because it was really something they were damn good at.
__label__2 A Near Perfect Album: If I could only take a few CD's to a desert Island, this disc would be with me. Jonatha and Jennifer harmonize just about as beautifully as I have ever heard. The lyrics are intelligent, original, clever and interesting. This album has a nice blend of pretty songs and ones that get you up and moving. Near Perfection!
__label__2 for everyone! great read: I found it to be very well written. Some health books can put you to sleep. Liz Applegate knows here stuff and knows how to write about it. She's smart and sensitive about life. She makes it clear and in laypersons terms.The book should be read by everyone wanting to learn about nutrition and health.Thank you, Liz Applegate for making me interested in health again
__label__2 Understanding McLuhan is essential to understanding media: McLuhan was not the first to open up the field of media study with the focus on the media rather than content. But he was the first to see that ALL human artifacts create their own context of effects, and McLuhan remains unsurpassed in the breadth and depth of his understanding. No field of human endeavor goes unaffected by media environments, and this generous collection is well suited to the serious inquirer, whether new to McLuhan or revisiting him with the onset of the latest manifestations of the electronic age--the web and internet
__label__1 McGrath repeats himself again ad nauseum: If there ever was a writer whose entire opus consisted of cutting and pasting from one book to another then McGrath is him! Blackwell has done an excellent job of marketing his comependium of encyclopedias, moographs, readers, and commentaries. A clear writer who delivers his presribed message.Amazing how little it takes to be an Oxford Don these days! Excellent material for the novice. His work on Justification however, is outstanding.
__label__1 we all make mistakes: very unhappy after parting with $70AU for a book that I believe at best would get a 5 out of ten for a year 7 school kid, amazon should filter the junk they sell this is the second book from amazon like this. I won't be making a 3rd mistake. anyway this is a thin book with no color photos (very uninspiring) I actually think the author is either PLAYING A joke or the editor HAD A VENDETOR AGAINST THE GENERAL PUBLIC. All in all extremely dissapointed I want my money back amazon. P.S. I'd be skeptical off the other reveiws
__label__1 I couldn't figure it out: I bought this book because I my 12 year old son likes to make candles. I thought this would be a great addition. Although the story behind the writer was captivating, I couldn't quite figure out what supplies I need, where to get them or how to get started. I'm in need of easy lists and more step by steps, and this book couldn't provide that.
__label__2 one of my faves: I can't live without Jessica Fletcher. I need to have this season to complete my collection. Every night i settle in for another adventure with Jessica and she never disappoints.
__label__2 Great Value GPS: The Good:Product works very well.Maps are accurate.User interface is effective.Great display.The Not So Good:Sometimes sluggish with new route calculations.Battery life is fairly short.I have now bought two I have liked the device so much.
__label__2 Get about what you paid for: I bought this locally on sale for $167. It freezes regularly near the beginning of a trip, which requires 2 reboots jabbing with a pen. That's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. My only other misgiving is that if you miss a turn, it often wants you to double back in a big circle. Other than that, it's cheap, fast, easy-to-use, easy-to-install, and effective. The price makes up for shortcomings vs. other models. Note, if you live in an area where GPSes are frequently stolen (and windows smashed), this one is a bit difficult to remove from its mount. I tend to leave the suction cup on, remove the unit, and bring it with me.
__label__1 Worst customer support in the history of electronics: After purchasing this device we went to their website to upgrade the software. Well, the upgrade failed miserably and rendered the device inoperable....so Magellan asked us to send it in and they would reprogram it. Well, we sent it in, and they completely deny ever receiving it, even though we have the tracking information that shows when it was delivered. Keep in mind that we had to send it to Texas, even though every single customer service rep we talk to is in the Phillipines. Yeah, that is helpful. They won't send us a new one, and they can't find the old one, we are stuck. We filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. STAY AWAY FROM MAGELLAN!!!!
__label__2 Amazing: This is a surprising small yet full of addreses. The only problem is that infrequently it gives the directions as if you are coming from the opposit direction
__label__1 LOW VOLUMN: I have asked the tech support about the LOW VOLUMN and they said that "what you hear is what you get". Too bad they think this way since I can not hear the directions when driving with the radio on low low this unit is useless to me. Please check out other GPS's before you spend your money.
__label__2 magellan maesto 3100: it is the best purchase my husband and i have made, sets us on a straight course everytime.
__label__1 the unit stinks: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS UNIT !!!!! I WAS TOLD I WOULD RECEIVE 1 FREE UPDATE WHEN I PURCHASED IT !! WHEN THE UPDATE CAME OUT THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD COST ME $80. I E-MAILED THEM AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHAT I WAS TOLD AND THEY REFUSED TO HONOR THE UPGRADE. THE POINTS OF INTEREST ARE VERY LIMITED. MY WIFE HAS A GARMIN AND IT IS GREAT!!! 6MILLION POINTS OF INTERESTS AND 1 FREE UPDATE. I TELL EVERYBODY TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM AND BUY A GARMIN. THE ONLY REASON I PURCHASED IT WAS THE FREE UPDATE. THE MAPS ARE 2006 AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE. i WILL NEVER BUY A MAGELLAN AGAIN!!!!
__label__2 Great for the price: I have used my Magellan with great success.Not being the one for great written directionsit has helped me a great deal.My only complaint are the instructions with the packageneed to be more informative re the need to downloador to upgrade.
__label__2 Overall Good Quality: Overall good service from this little thing. Here's a few things that went wrong already: when going to George Washington Bridge in NY, it suggested a slightly longer alternate route right before entering the bridge. It may be that it didn't know of a new, shorter path to the bridge. No problem there. On our way back into NYS, right after the bridge, it lost track of its path and it froze. We tried re-entering the address, but it wouldn't turn back on. Only after we reset it did it come back, even then, with a delay.I think that if you need only the basics of navigation, (and some POIs) without all the bells and whistles, it's a great buy at the price of $160.
__label__2 Just right!: The packaging for this unit was outstanding. I was concerned about ordering such a fragile item online but it arrived in perfect condition. Picture quality is flawless, breathtaking?. Sound is excellent. Overall it's a terrific value for the money. Best of all, it's not too big, and not too little.
__label__1 Not a good buy: I have a 30" audiovox LCD already, and I was shocked at how much better the picture on the audivox was compared to the Syntax. The product specs say the Syntax is a better telivision but the proof is in the picture. The picture quality was very poor and the colors are just not normal tones. If you plan on hooking up your cable with this TV, buy a differnet TV. The picture is very poor quality. I was very disapointed.
__label__1 Distortion in Aspect except 4::3: You'll see a circle as a circle only on Aspect 4:3. The other aspect "zoom" make the circle looks like an egg. No adjustment in vertical or Horizontal. The manual stated the "ZOOM" will enlarge the 4:3 without distortion. But it is not, it enlarged more in Horizontal than Vertical. Tech Support said that it is pre-set in manufacture, they can't correct it. I need the ZOOM aspect to watch the wide screen movie.I compare it with Westinghouse, the Westinghouse is better, more options, easier use on Remote.Some credits I have to give to both TV is that No Dead Pixel.
__label__2 My favorite of Michael's work: OK, let's face it, Michael Feinstein isn't for everyone. Some people think he's too sappy, a weaker Frank Sinatra, and so on. That said, I think this album is for everyone. From his eloquent cover of Van Morrison's "Moondance" to his own "Half of April" each and every one of these songs is performed with heart and a gentle touch. This is very much unlike his "songbook" albums - where he takes one composer's work and does it to death - which is what generally comes to mind with Michael's work , here there is a more eclectic style that gives you a truer sense of the great range and talent he posesses.
__label__2 One of Feinstein's Best!: Feinstein sings several standards wonderfully but the real attraction for me is his going to songs that are not as well known. He has lovely, mellow versions of Soon, Time Enough for Love, and I'll Be There. This is one of my favorite CD's which is always a pleasure to hear.
__label__2 Wonderful product: My sister recommended this product when I complained about my peeling nails. It has worked wonders for me for several years now. I hope to always be able to order it from Amazon.com.As one review already mentioned, I now have to actually cut my nails off to keep them from being TOO LONG!
__label__1 Glad that I didn't pay for it.: I was really glad that after reading "Elegance" by Kathleen Tessaro that I didn't pay for it. I really had high hopes for this book. It looked like that it was going to be good book, but the truth is that it was not a good book. Louise Canova is a American living in London married to an English actor. At thirty-two she acts like at lease fifteen years older. Until she finds a book called "Elegance" by Madame Dariaux in a second hand shop. This small book leads Louise to make some major changes in her life.This is really not that good. The author left major wholes the story that just didn't sense to me. I kept hoping that Ms. Tessaro would fill in the holes, but she didn't.The reason that I gave "Elegance" two stars is because of the work of Madame Dariaux,who's book will be selling on Amazon.com in August.
__label__1 No sympathy for this narrator: I agree with much of what Abby said, below. This book is very disappointing. If you are expecting a fun, witty Helen Fielding-style book, you're going to be disappointed.Tessaro breaks a most basic rule of writing by telling the reader how the main characters are feeling rather than showing it. It feels forced. But the main problem I have with this book is that the main character, Louise, is very unappealing. She comes across as selfish and shallow and self-obsessed. Tessaro obviously wants us to think "you go, girl!" when Louise tells us about flirting openly with her husbands' colleagues; instead, I marvelled at how I was supposed to like a character who did these kinds of pathetic things. Finally, the whole premise of the book is weak - that by wearing tight clothes and putting on makeup, you can transform your life. Louise may become more physically attractive, but that doesn't change the fact that her character, like this book, leaves much to be desired.
__label__1 very dissapoint that i read this book: while i was ready to buy this book one of my friends informed me that she already had it and gave it to me. The only precious reading in this book is the first page of each chapter that references to Antoine Darioux.For my opinion is the only information you can take concerning elegnce. The rest material is information that are worthless regarding to elegance and i have surely been beglamoured by the tittle.
__label__1 Must Read For Beginners: If you are new to blackjack, this book will save you many hours of trying to memorize tables and charts contained in longer books. Braids provides an illustrated easy to use guide to casino play, with two simple logical rules for quickly reasoning the correct play of any hand. Also his explanation of card counting is the clearest I've ever read. I now understand the underlying logic behind the many counting systems out there. You will find blackjack strategies much less confusing after reading this book.Amazon.com Sales Rank:Today: #1,671,436 in BooksYesterday: #1,671,873 in Books
__label__2 Provides a sharp look and functional too: Prior to this cover I had one that went all the way down to the ground. Not only did it make my grill look like a trash heap, but a couple of field mice found it worked real well as a ladder into my grill for the winter.With this grill cover option, my grill looks much better and does not welcome unwanted visitors.
__label__1 I am so glad I never purchased the movie!: If you have the choice between watching the old versions of the Twillight Zone and Uninvited Guest, watch the Twillight Zone. My eyebrow was arched in confusion the whole time... and all I could think was... "This is Bull!". The whole movie in theory was a big 'free-writing' assignment. The plot(s) had no rhyme or reason. Give me "Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder" anytime from the Twillight Zone instead of that ball of confusion!
__label__2 Good Movie: This was a good movie but I caution you to see it and judge for yourself. If you look at the reviews listed on this page, several loved it, several hated it and some were in between. Which tells you that reveiws don't mean a thing. The only review that matters is yours when you see it. I thought it was very entertaining and there were some cheesy parts but for the most part, I enjoyed it.W.S.
__label__2 One of Webb's Best: Amazon needs to get the Bob Wills album cover down from the site, the one for Suspending Disbelief would be more appropriate! This is far from Jimmy Webb's last album, but certainly one of his best. His fans know what a treat this CD was when it first came out (1992), (first in 10 years)...after seven years I'm still listening to it. Best songs: Too Young To Die, I Don't Know How To Love You Anymore, Elvis & Me, and the Grand Finale....I Will Arise...a "Copelandesque" version of some old standard hymns. Only the genius of Jimmy Webb could conceive of this and pull it off so well.
__label__2 Good album, but not his best: Too Young To Die and Elvis And Me are great songs on this one. The rest is pleasant enough, but not as good as Letters, Words & Music or And So On (which hasn't appeared on CD).
__label__2 Amazing!: This CD is truly amazing! No one can sing the Hanuman Chalesa like Krishna Das. Every variation of this song is beautiful and the additional CD of pronunciation is incredibly helpful for those of us who would like to learn how to sing along with Krishna Das' incredible voice. Every time I play this CD during one of my yoga classes, I have students asking for the name of the CD at the end of class. This CD moves me to my soul every time I listen to it. Even my five-year old tells me that listening to his CD "makes his heart happy". This is a must-have CD!
__label__1 not helped me: I used this product as described. So far more than half of box of it is gone, no positive results at all.
__label__1 hair loss: This product did not work for me. I saw no difference in my hair after using the entire package. I liked the delivery system; it was easy to use.
__label__1 Constant headache...: In all fairness, the one that I have is probably an older model. But it looks exactly the same. I have had it for about three years now and finally threw it away the other day because I had just had enough of the issues. It constantly binds up. The tension knob was a problem. I am turned off by Brother after this one. This new model may be better, but I am getting a Singer in the future.
__label__2 easy: easy to use, took us an hour to figure out initially, but now comes as second nature. delivered timely as usual
__label__2 Great Sewing Machine!: The machine gets a 9 from me- the ONLY complaint is you can't adjust the speed-its just fast. Works great, its easily portable, the price was great also. One last thing, the instructions are pretty bad. I found them hard to understand so I just ended up youtubing the directions on how to thread the machine. Im a beginner and those instructions had me completely confusef.
__label__2 perfect: Its simple yet has everything to different stiches to a compact box to put lil tools in a small great size. Works well, the product is perfect!
__label__1 poor instructions: between 3 people, we were unable to figure out the proper way to thread this machine. we read the instructions multiple times, and it actually worked for about 2 minutes, & then became a tangled mess.
__label__1 Bobbin troubles: My ten year old daughter bought this for herself with her birthday money and has had a VERY difficult time with it. Every time she gets it threaded, within minutes it is no longer working properly and she has to rethread the entire machine. We are taking it to a sewing shop for a review but are thinking of returning it as defective merchandise.
__label__1 Glad it worked for others, not for me.: This is the worst machine I have ever used!!!! I've been sewing for over 30 years, and have used many different brands. Maybe I just got a bad machine, but it makes me hate sewing. Very unstable, tension is always out of wack, and it can't sew through more than two layers of thicker fabric.
__label__1 This machine is horrid fr beginners: There is no way to slow down the speed at all! It goes full speed or no speed and bunches up the fabric horribly. I had planned on sewing on paper first but it was just way fast. I returned it. Don't buy it.
__label__2 Mouth Pleasing and Healthy Too!: WOW! I am impressed with these snacks. A whole apple in each bar and no added suger of any kind! I love the convenience of these fruit bars. We snack mostly on fruit here in the house, but sometimes it's not convenient to carry fruit with you on outings. So I've been looking for something like this for a long time and it's better than I expected, much better than most fruit leathers you can find in a health store.These strawberry snacks have also been tested by a three and four year old pallet and they always ask for more.They're so good I've ordered more of another flavor.
__label__1 Taste like a pureed apple with some strawberry flavoring: I can't believe how wonderful all the reviews were of this snack. I was expecting a strawberry chewy snack, but got an apple with some strawberry flavoring. Really this is not what you expect. It has a mushed up apple consistency. Neither my husband or I liked this product. Buy small quantities to make sure you approve, I have 58 of them left to stomach or give away.
__label__1 Sucks compared to Visor: This is a Palm device and does what normal PalmPilots do...but not much else. If you're going to get a 2 MB unit, get the Visor Solo, which is $20 more and supports USB and has an expansion slot. For users that actually need more than 2 MB (like me), buy the 8 MB Visor Deluxe...
__label__2 Oi! This is England: In my opinion this is a very good box set.With a wide selection of Oi! greats.Such as the Buisness,4-skins,Cock sparrer,Combat 84 and Infa-riot.It contains a box set of 3 cd's with about 27 tracts per.If your into Oi! and and have no money like me this is a good one. Cheers Jesse
__label__2 Small kids need supervision with this one: Our house is the place to play when these are brought outside. The kids love it but kids need to be supervised when this is used. Kids just being kids will try things which they shouldn't. lol. My nephew broke his collar bone when he had the ramps too far apart.
__label__2 Working Hard: It's very simple- Jillian Michaels is a beast. If you are not ready for this workout it will kick your butt and your legs will be wobbling and sore for a couple of days. My suggestion is to ease into it. Do a couple of sets a day for maybe a week before jumping into the whole workout. None of the moves are difficult on their own but put the whole workout together and it's pretty tough for the average person.If you want to buy it, I'd say go for it, it will get you the results you want as long as you use it regularly. Good luck!
__label__2 One Seriously Tought Workout: This workout is tough and I like it! This video hits all of the major muscle groups and uses the same circuit training techniques that Jillian employes in the 30 day Shred. This is a great add-on to the 30-day shred, but don't make the mistake of trying this one first if you are new to fitness. If you are ready to increase your stength and stamina, this is a great video to add to your collection.
__label__2 It works if you do!!: I have been using this video for about 2 weeks now. I do it in alteration with 2 other videos by Jillian. I have dropped about 6 inches so far. Of course you get out of it what you put in, so I am getting expected results. She really delivers what she promises. I am an athletic person and she works muscles I didn't know I had. If you think you would like her as a trianer on Biggest Loser, you will like her on these workouts!
__label__1 Beware: DVD will not work on your PC: I would really like to try this video. So far I have not been able to get it to play. It seems to send out some kind of an alert when played on a computer. I was able to watch the bonus features which was just an ill conceived infomercial for an electric toothbrush. I have heard good things about her line of videos, but the expectation that you are buying a professionally made DVD that will play in all devices seems like a pretty basic one.
__label__2 good video: I like this video enough, though it is on the dull side.This isn't any cardio so if someone is looking for that, then this is the wrong video!The ab section while good, made me feel really sick. I've had that happen before when I focus on abs so I won't blame this video for that.This is a great video for the arms and thighs in particular
__label__2 Good DVD: Jillian Michaels does a very good job of targeting "trouble zones" in this workout. When I finished I was out of breath and sore all over!! You really do get a lot of different exercises that target different areas. Would recommend this to others.
__label__2 No More Trouble Zones- My Opinion: Im 21.. I bought this DVD because I'm a little bored of the gym at the moment and the other dvd I have is a dance/aerobic one and I wanted a weights one for toning. It came in the mail on Tuesday so i decided to give it a go (starting with 2kg Weights)--> It was a hard workout! and i exercise 4-5 times a week.It is now Thursday (2 days later) and I am still sore from it! (my legs and butt have never been so sore) So i know it works!!I would recomend for beginners to do this dvd the first time without hand weights. Your legs and butt will still get a great workout.I really liked it because I am so sore, so I know it works! Just a little scared for when I do it again :) enjoy!
__label__2 Best Toning DVD: I use the DVD multiple times a week and boy she still can kick my rear to Timbuktu and back. Love it. Best DVD out there for toning your body. Want to look lean and feel strong? Get this DVD ASAP!
__label__2 Fantastic Workout!: Jillian is awesome! This workout is incredible. I bought it based on all of the great reviews here on Amazon, and the video did not disappoint. Jillian keeps things interesting and fun while keeping me motivated. I highly recommend this workout!
__label__2 JM, I hate to love you: I am generally a "Firm Believer" and have done 25+ different workouts from the Firm over the years. I was looking for something a little different so I decided to give Jillian a try after trying one of her free workouts from my On Demand Cable workout channel. That workout got me interested in trying more of JM's stuff.I got this workout based on the reviews, and I have not been disappointed. This workout is tough and it hurts! Jillian's "surrender" move makes me want to give up, and her ab work is killer. I also like the length of this workout and really feel like I did something when it is done. It really does work the "trouble zone" and when it was over I was sore in all the right places (abs, glutes, shoulders, triceps, and legs).Overall, I am a Jillian convert. I hate her during the workout, but I love her when it is done :)
__label__2 love this trainer: I am out of shape, and started her 20 minute workouts a few weeks ago. This one kicked my butt, and I deviated a bit at times, and did slightly less strenuous movements for some of them. Even so, a great workout; works different muscles. I love her theory of never stop moving, no rest breaks until you are done
__label__2 Healing Angel: You will not be disappointed with this CD. Roma Downey, with her her lovely voice of the Irish,and paired up with Phil Coulter on the piano, make this an outstanding CD. Listening to Roma Downey, will bring you back to the basic values of life, that we all have forgotten, and wish we could, all return to.
__label__2 good: it is good and i enjoy it and i recommend it to a lot people. my friends and family enjoy it too. people of all ages and faith like it.
__label__2 lynne s music: Very inspirational ,easy to listen to and beleivable . Roma has a wonderful voice .Listen to mine often ,especially when I feel the world is against me, I would certainly recomend this cd ,heavenly music.
__label__2 Loving: I have only heard a few things off of this cd. I must say that I was really really impressed with it. I heard the "Loving" track at a friend's wedding. It was so touching and so lovely. I know already that I want this to be played at my wedding (*Whenever that may be lol*) Roma Downey is a very talented person and I commend her on making this album!
__label__2 finally!: Finally a band that are funny guys ,down to earth and rock the stage live. This album only emphasizes a part of them and it is amazing. The music is composed wonderfully and the lyrics show you that they are up there for the music and fans ,not the money!(although I'm sure it wouldn't hurt, SO GO BUY THEIR CD!!!)
__label__2 Amazing group.: From start to finish this album rocks. I have seen Faktion play 3 times live and each time it has been great. Quit reading my review and go buy the album, then find out when they are touring near your town and go see them.
__label__2 AWESOME!: This CD is Awesome. I play it everywhere..Im sure my neighbors hate me but... OH well.. this CD is Great... I have my 7 yo singing some of the songs.. Raisin the Kids the right way.. :-)
__label__2 Original and Moving Rock: Faktion is an extremely talented band able to grip you with some very moving songs and also rock with the best of them. Lyrically their songs will give you something to think about, which is always refreshing in this world of cookie-cutter music. The harder songs are great on bad-mood days as well. But their live performances bring it all together and help you see why they are where they are. Simply put, Faktion rocks the house!!
__label__2 by far the best band i have heard in a long time!!: I think that this cd/band is by far the best I have heard in a very long time... it takes alot for a band to impress me... and faktion completely blew me away! I would very highly reccommend them to anyone, and i have already been spreading the word about these guys all over NY! I am hoping to get to see these guys play sometime soon, i am sure their live performance is better than the recordings, and the recordings are amazing! to sum everything all up into a few words... THESE GUYS ROCK HARDCORE!!
__label__2 greatt cd: this is a great cd..i first heard take it all away on sirius radio and i had to go buy the cd when it came out..the whole cd is good...buy it!
__label__1 Alright Starter Yoke: I purchased a CH Yoke as my first flight yoke; I've had many joysticks and throttles before. I was expecting this to be great, I've heard many good things about this products and it is one in a few that are in the price range.Pros: It's USB and installs easily. It works with almost all Flight Sims (including Microsoft's FSX and X-Plane)Cons: It seems to be cheaply made, thin plastics. It doesn't mount well to most desks and tables that I have tried it on.The BIG disadvantage that I cannot stand is in the pitch axis. It's impossible to return it to neutral! This is due to the springs not always placing the yoke back to it centered point.I do NOT recommend this yoke to any REAL pilots; it will frustrate you to no end. It is however acceptable for simple gamers and children for a first Flight Yoke.I'm purchasing Saitek's Throttle Quadrants and looking forward to buying Saitek's Flight yoke as well.
__label__2 Works well and easily: Plug it in to the USB and go. No problems whatsoever, and it certainly improves use of a flight simulator.
__label__2 Much higher quality than it looks in the picture!: Does everything I want. I'd never play a Flight Sim without it.Feels much higher quality than I had anticipated judging from the pictures.I've only had it for a month so I don't know about reliability yet.
__label__2 Good Flight Sim Yoke: It is the best flight sim yoke I ever tried. My only problem with this product is that I have to use a button for trimming in MS Flight Simulator. The built-in trim does not work in MS Flight Simulator.
__label__2 Great and real!!!: I use this the joy stick every day but there is one problem. It does not stand on it's own to make it drivable.
__label__1 Defective with poor warranty: Mine was defective, and they want me to pay shipping both ways to get one that is not defective.
__label__1 CH Products Flight Sim Yoke (USB): The mechanical design is somehow flawed. I expected the yoke to slide back and forward with ease and return to center when released. The movement should be on ball bearings for the price of the product. Instead, the yoke return position (controlled by springs, I am guessing) stopped anywhere in a +/- 0.5 inch location. The simulators I use react to this movement and I am constantly correcting. Maybe I some how received a product that slipped through QC. I am dissappointed. I could design one better than the one I purchased and cannot recommend this product.
__label__1 Way overpriced!: The pitch sticks so bad that it's nearly impossible to maintain level flight.I sent it back and it was returned saying it was fixed!Yea right! All they did was spray some kind of silicone lube on the shaft and called it fixed!The pitch SHOULD work as smoothly as the roll.Not worth the money as far as I am concerned!
__label__2 All as it should be: I received the book, which is fantastic by the way, in perfect condition. It arrived as stated and on time. All is well with this purchase. Thank you.
__label__1 Lose Laurie!: Just saw this on DVR (taped off cable) and was appalled at how intrusive the soundtrack is. Spalding Gray doesn't need a soundtrack, never mind one that is as jab-you-in-the-eye-with-a-stick obnoxious as this one. The zooming and cutting and background images were also annoying, but I think I could have lived with that. The music (by Laurie Andersen) is almost always unsuited to the subject matter. And it is so loud at some points that I had trouble following what he was saying. A total miscalculation in my opinion. Just because they were both in the NYC downtown arts scene doesn't mean they belong together! Glad to see that I can delete it from my DVR, because I can always buy this DVD if I feel compelled to watch it again. I don't think that I will, though.
__label__2 Encouraging & Informative eye-opener: I was asked to read this book by the Prostate Cancer Charity in UK and on first sight my heart sank. Full of dry medical information - how wrong I was! My husband had a radical prostatectomy in 1997 and has recovered well but I still found encouraging material - especially about managing impotence. The book covers all aspects of prostate cancer - from diagnosis to living with the results of treatment. It deals with the medical terms and emotional effects of each stage in a down to earth manner. I also really valued the fact that it was written to me - the woman. It made me feel understood in a way that much of literature doesn't as it all male orientated. Enjoy reading it as you approach stage by stage and keep dipping into for knowledgeable reassurrance. My one regret was that all the helpful contact numbers and addresses were all American.
__label__1 NOt everyone has a woman to help them: I saw this book online, and thought, who are they writing for. I then read it and felt entirely left out. The authors barely suggest that gay men exist on this planet and many of them have prostate cancer. Thank goodness for other books and [...]for helping out of a pickle. At best, this book uses the word love, but does not seem to include me.
__label__1 Disappointing: I was very disappointed by my first visit to the Pennyfoot. This is 12th in the series and the author must be ready to "get rid" of the characters and it shows. The plot is rushed and contrived and the characters were stereotypes one and all. Perhaps if I had been following the series through several books I would have felt differently. Recommend not purchasing, instead borrow from library.
__label__2 Rotisserie experience: I recently purchased my Weber at a yard sale for $15!!!!! I was so excited I went online to search for a rotisserie and found the best deal at Amazon.com I am extrememly happy with the product...
__label__2 Exactly as promised!: Product arrived more quickly than I expected. It was packed extremely well, and made the trip without any bent corners. Described as being "new," it could only have been more new if it were in original shrinkwrap. Will definitely use this vendor again.
__label__2 Great Foreign Film: Even if you are not a fan of the Death Note Anime series, this movie collection delivers mind boggling suspense and intrigue. The battle of the wits the viewer witnesses is action packed and entertaining!
__label__1 could be better: the movie was decent at best but they went so far from canon that it wasn't really deathnote anymore. the only bright spot was that L won so we don't have to put up with the inadequate heroes Near and Mellow.
__label__1 Wish I would have seen these reviews first.....: This software is absolutely terrible. In fact, I believe it HINDERED my wedding planning process. The guest list manager is very difficult to work with, I would have much preferred a plain excel document to type in! It was not at all user friendly, and what I expected out of wedding planning software was not at all fulfilled. I needed software that would work with a Mac, so didn't have many options. If I had to go back, I'd save myself $30 and use a free site like the knot. And if you register at Bed Bath & Beyond they offer a free service that does WAY more than this software does. It didn't even include a decent timeline of what you're supposed to be doing when - which is WHY I got wedding planning software! You basically have to manually type everything in.I would rate it less than 1 star if I could. If you are planning a wedding and looking for software, trust me - look elsewhere!!
__label__1 Do not waste your money, you can find a better map for free downtown in the tourist center.: I bought this for an upcoming trip to Copenhagen. My husband the expert navigator that he is got really irritated with it and refused to use it. We found a better map for free at the tourist center located downtown. It's pretty easy to find, it's the one that has a bakery in the same room. Save your money don't buy this thing it's useless and overpriced.
__label__2 It Works!: Was getting a funky, yet sweet smell coming from the HVAC system (most likely mildew) in my brand new car. Read about this stuff on an Audi enthusiast forum, but couldn't find it in any of the local auto parts stores. Saw Amazon had it, pulled the trigger, followed the instructions and wouldn't you know it- the smell was gone! This was last summer and the HVAC system is still going strong. I highly recommend this stuff for anyone who needs to clean out their heating/ac unit in their car.
__label__2 Works as intended: It removed the smell but it tends to come back. I think I need multiple treatments because the car sat for a while.
__label__2 Very Helpfull: I recently discovered I have a heart condition that affects what sports activities I should be doing. Being an extremely competitive person that competes in a high level of various sports I did not take the news well. This book has helped immensly with tonnes of advice on diets and supplements. I have even used it to help out other family members with different conditions from Weight loss to high blood pressure.
__label__1 Wonderful Bowls, but price increase of $10 in 3 months.: I really loved these bowls, but there is a $10 price increase in 3 months. Less than 3 months. It makes it really difficult when people are trying to save and yet still purchase items they need in these days and times. Too bad.
__label__2 good reading: good reading. I really enjoy reading Hannah Howell, she is an excellent writter. I have read most of her books and have never been disappointed.
__label__2 the strange world of public libraries: The second book of comics about the Mallville Public Library is just as funny and true as the first.If you want to try before you buy, you can read their entire archive online at http://www.overduemedia.com or buy a 'Read Responsibly' t-shirt.
__label__2 Cane Guard Guardian, Narrow Base: I bought this silver quad cane for my 85 year old mom. She has severe arthritis in her knees and this four pronged cane gives her the stability she needs to walk around. She uses the cane everywhere she goes. This cane has given her more independence and mobility. She definitely recommends this cane. The delivery was fast and the price was very good!
__label__2 REALY GREAT IMPROVMENT: EASY TO USE,NO ERROR CODES ALL THE TIME.CONTOUR CUFF IS MUCH EASER TO WRAP THAN OTHER MODELS.I WILL NOT MENTION OTHER BRAND, BUT TO SAY THIS IS A MUCH BETTER UNIT.
__label__2 Love It -- And -- It Loves Me: Greatest Home BP Monitor there is. Very simple to use, extremely accurate, and top quality. Highly recommended by my Doctor.
__label__1 Check measurements before you buy: Way too small! Barely fits on an adult head, but fit my 2-year-old son perfectly!
__label__2 FROM A NARUTO FAN!: This was a great box set! It contains episodes 150-163 all of the episodes were wonderful! Some of the episodes kept me on the edge of my seat, while some made me burst out laughing! It was an enjoyable product and I highly reccomend it! It also came with Naruto playing cards! I enjoyed this box set so much I went ahead and bought the next one! ^_^
__label__1 Not impressed: The editing on the dvd is messed up so you have to watch all parts everytime you do you exercise, you can't just skip to the exercises. This alone makes this product useless.
__label__2 Worked awesome: I used it on my 1990 Jeep Cherokee. The headliner was like a tent falling. I took out and prepped the headliner board. Then sprayed on the glue as per the directions "onto foam backing and also onto headliner board", let it sit for the time stated, spread the new headliner on and it has been perfect ever since. Did it at the end of winter "Jan 2010" and it went through a lot of 100+ days during the summer and never came undone. But if you don't follow the directions and put it one before the allotted time it may fail. That is why there are directions on the back of the can. It is a chemical and needs to cure for a certain amount of time so it will adhere to both parts being glued.I love how it came out and I think this glue is excellent.
__label__2 Just Finished...Susanna Keeps Getting Better: Susanna Carr's book Lip Lock was a good read. I usually can't find time to sit and read a novel for enjoyment but I was able to keep coming back to this one. I was disappointed that I figured out the "whodunit" at the point that Molly was fired, but the motive was interesting. The whole book was well-crafted and proof that Susanna gets better with each book. ("Sister Switch" from "Beach Blanket Bad Boys" was choppy, rushed and not good at all.) I just bought "Valentine's Day is Killing Me" to read "Valentine Survivor" and I hope that it is as good as the teaser excerpt.
__label__1 Fiskar's rolling craft crate: I was very disappointed in the product. I thought it would be more usable than it is. Each pocket that holds the scissors are literally only big enough for the tip of the scissors or a pencil/pen, the other pockets aren't big enough to even hold a 12 pack of colored pencils. I thought it would be great for taking back and forth to my Daisy Girl Scout Meetings but it's not. Who needs 15 pockets for scissors?!! The only great use for this item, which I can see, would be for avid scrapbookers--I think it would be perfect for them!
__label__2 Great modest entertainment for families or children under 10: If you are a fan of the classic mysteries including The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew or Tom Swift, this modest production of a small town mystery is your cup of tea.... or evening nightcap! Funny and hysterical in parts, yet engrossing from a young child's point of view, this modest production reminds me of the matinee serials produced for the double-bill motion pictures of yesterday. Endearing, fun, intriguing, this movie is fine entertainment and provides a great theme in appreciating and making the most of your surroundings.
__label__2 Great CD Judged Unfairly: Tightrope is undoubtedly one of the most misjudged CD's Brooks & Dunn have ever made. The ballads on this CD are fantastic. Ronnie Dunn's vocals are magnificent .. Kix's best work to date, I still play this CD quite a lot . Still one of my favorite CD's It's a great CD to get lost in,.
__label__1 A major flop!: What the hell were they thinking! This album really takes a nose dive since their debut album did so well! Fragmented and odd with no real style or substance to this album! No good!
__label__2 Captivating: Ms. Rilling's book epitomizes the true essence of the power of love.The story line immediately grabs your attention and easily holdsit from beginning to end. The author has captured a very magical,mystical feeling through out the entire book.I savored every minute of this delightfully captivating story.
__label__1 let down: 1st off, i love josh. dressed up like nebraska is one of my favourite records. i ddnt like this one very much. whoever he collaborated with, i wish he'd stayed by himself instead. 2 of the songs on the record caught me, but the rest i didnt like. hopefully when the new record comes out, it will be better.
__label__1 Doesn't stick to leather/fabric AT ALL - don't waste your $$$.: Useless. This was suggested to me to prevent my cat from scratching my leather chair, and it doesn't stick at all. If I even lightly touch it, it sticks to my finger and falls off the chair. Now I remember trying this on a fabric chair 4-5 years ago to keep my kitten from scratching and I remember it didn't work on fabric either. Useless stuff, don't waste your money - find another solution. In the meantime I have the vacuum cleaner against the corner of the chair she likes to scratch... that works better than this.
__label__1 Terrible for countertops: This is a terrible product for countertops. Did not deter my cat one bit from climbing all over the counters - I saw her walking around on them like it's nothing. Worst part is that after the thing failed to do any good I spent the better part of an afternoon scraping sticky residue from all my countertops - these strips do NOT come off clean, at least from the average grade kitchen counter surface. Tried a number of kitchen cleaners and they're still sticky. Can't say how well this works / how easy to remove on other surfaces, but for countertops, it was no good for my cat. If you still want to give it a try (cats are pretty different when it comes to this kind of thing) I would suggest covering the counters with tin foil first and putting the strips on the tin foil. That's what I wish I would've done (other than not shelling out ** bucks for this in the first place).
__label__2 One of the best projects in the Gospel Music Genre!!: Ms. McCullough's project "This is for you Lord" is absolutely phoenomenal!! The writing is great. There is not a "sleeper" on this release. The vocals by The Family and Lawrence Matthews are exceptional. The video captures the mood and excitement of the recording which was recorded live in Jamaica. Jackie's narrative portions on the video are inspiring and augment the overall production. If you buy just one video this year, get this one. You will watch it over and over. (I bought the CD, the casette and the video with the intent of blessing others with the inspiring music). The project was produced by Kevin Bond with assist by Jason White a powerful production duo. You won't regret getting this one!!
__label__2 All Weight Watchers Cookbooks are Tasty: Seriously I am a very busy lady and love these cookbooks. Quick, simple and healthy...
__label__1 Beautiful but impractical: The lay-out & the photographs in this book were beautiful but there were very few dishes that were practical to cook on a regular basis. I consider myself to be an above average cook but these recipes called for too much time and too many out of the ordinary ingredients to bother with. I've tried to find recipes to use from this book but it has really become a "stay on the shelf" cookbook.
__label__2 our liittle Texas stray: He said if we gave hin work he'd do the best he couldthough he didn't know straight-up about a cowso the boss he cut him out a mount and kindly put him onhe said he sorta liked this little kid somehow.Little Joe the wrangler was called out with the restscarcely had the fellow reached the herdwhen the cattle they stamped like a hail storm as they fledand everyone was riding for the lead.Amid streaks of lightin' there was one horse up aheadtrying to check the leaders in their speedIt was Little Joe the wrangler with a slicker o'er his headriding ol Blue Rocket for the lead.At last we got 'em milling and kinda quieted downand the extra guards to the wagons they did gobut there was one of us missing, we could see at a glanceit was our little Texas stray poor Wrangler Joe.---Jack Thorpe
__label__1 uncomfortable: These panties were not comfy at all. I agree that the front seam cut me in half and rubbed in the wrong place. I threw them in the garbage after one hour. The other Hanes boy briefs were much more comfy but I cannot find them anywhere. The looked like real boy briefs and were so easy to wear, no riding up or cutting int the wrong place. I would not buy anything with a center seam again.
